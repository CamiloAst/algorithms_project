  abstract={This paper suggests a Cyberlearning tool based on a highly innovative assessment methodology that helps teachers with computer science education. Currently, there is a strong push to integrate aspects of programming and coding into the classroom environment. However, few if any tools exist that enable real-time formative assessment of in-class programming tasks. The proposed REACT (Real Time Evaluation and Assessment of Computational Thinking) system is a first step toward allowing teachers to see which high-level concepts students have mastered and which ones they are struggling with as students code in real time. REACT supports and facilitates the teaching of 21st century computing skills such as computational thinking [1] in the classroom environment.},

  abstract={This thesis study is an evaluation tool that measures the user's Computational Thinking (CT) according to its performance on Block-Based Programming Languages (BBPL) by using Machine Learning Techniques. The evaluation tool makes an evaluation for Machine Learning Model and each of the Computational Thinking seven fields. Via this developed tool, the objective is to product an alternative to the limited evaluation tools on Block-Based Programming Languages. Literature research was brought out in two sides as Machine Learning and Block-Based Programming Languages. In the first stage, on Machine Learning, the data set and the methods used in educational field were researched. In the second stage, the devices which are used to measure the performance on Block- Based Programming Languages were analyzed. On literature, there are various sources for teaching Computational Thinking ,but it occurs that measuring instruments that evaluates Computational Thinking are inadequate. To evaluate Computational Thinking a machine learning model was trained. Trained model was turned into online evaluation tool by which both the tutors and the students evaluate Computational Thinking easily. In the final stage, the developed online evaluation tool and the outcome was analyzed.},

  abstract={Programming robots playing with the environment is an ongoing research project aimed at developing a robot and intervention program capable of enhancing young children's cognitive abilities and computational thinking skills. Using a robot sensitive to color and distance, children are able to use everyday objects in order to interact with it and program its movements. An eleven session intervention program using this robot was designed with the objective of creating playful learning instances were children would practice abilities associated with what is generally thought of as computational thinking. We'll assess children's computational thinking, fluid intelligence, working memory, planning, sequencing, number recognition and magnitude comparison, vocabulary, mental rotation, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility to test for cognitive effects of the intervention. An active control in which children interact with the robot by remotely controlling it was used.},

  abstract={Today, Computational Thinking is seen as an important competency and the fourth skill that every child should process. Several significant attempts have been made to increase a student's exposure to Computational Thinking at the K-12 level, however the process is complex and requires systematic planning and comprehensive curriculum. In this paper, we describe the STEPP-UP program that aims to introduce middle schoolers to Computational Thinking via Scratch and Java coding sessions. A comprehensive curriculum and hands-on activities are applied to introduce Computational Thinking for a total of 41 students for a period of five semesters from Fall 2017 until Fall 2019. To assess the learning objectives, we used three methods of evaluation; design-scenarios, paper-assessments, and learner-documentation. Findings indicate that the students have increased knowledge of Computational Thinking and its applications for problem solving.},

  abstract={The present study focuses on comparing the achievement levels of computational thinking skills in first-year engineering students at two Peruvian universities, one located in an area with a high human development index (Lima) and the other in a more vulnerable area (Amazonas). The study is based on a computational thinking competence assessment model carried out with 112 students who were given challenges and problems. The results show that: (a) the achievement levels of computational thinking competences differ significantly between the Lima group and the Amazonas group, (b) the highest levels of competence achievement are associated with students who had some level of previous instruction in secondary education, and (c) the differences in the achievement of computational thinking skills according to student gender are not significant.},

  abstract={Recent college students have been observed to be motivated and engaged in acquiring information and communication technology (ICT) knowledge and skills with robots and digital media. The purpose of this study is to develop students’ technology comprehension through a learning activity by constructing robot-based storytelling systems. A sample of 15 college students participated in the program. Data collected include the pre-and post-computational thinking tests (CTt) and computational thinking skill (CTs) tests for evaluating their learning effects of technology comprehension (TC) in terms of computational thinking knowledge and skills and their perceptions toward the robot-based storytelling development environment and learning activities. The results show that the learning activities were an effective approach for enhancing the students’ TC as shown in the post-test. The differences between the students’ CT and perceptions were also confirmed. The results revealed that the learning activities with the robot-based storytelling development environment could improve the students’ TC knowledge and skills, and learning perceptions.},

  abstract={Learning to program is the new literacy of the 21st century. Computational thinking, closely related to programming, requires thinking and solving problems with different levels of abstraction and is independent of hardware devices. The early childhood education stage provides teachers with the opportunity to lay the foundations for a comprehensive quality education using innovative tools and technologies. Educational robotics in early childhood education becomes a tool that facilitates the acquisition of knowledge to children, playfully, based on the principles of interactivity, social interrelationships, collaborative work, creativity, constructivist and constructionist learning, and a student-centered didactic approach, allowing in turn that student can acquire digital competencies and develop logical and computational thinking in an underlying way. This project explores the current state of teaching and learning computational thinking and programming in early childhood education in an inclusive manner. Moreover, the lack of diversity and inequality is particularly latent in science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Therefore, this work considers this problem and presents an inclusive coeducation approach to this new literacy, eliminating gender stereotypes and extending them to people with Down syndrome and hospitalized minors.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking has recently returned into the limelight as an essential skill to have for both the general public and disciplines outside Computer Science. It encapsulates those thinking skills integral to solving complex problems using a computer, thus widely applicable in our technological society. Several public initiatives such as the Hour of Code successfully introduced it to millions of people of different ages and backgrounds, mostly using Blocks Programming Environments like Scratch that lower the barriers of programming and facilitate learning. In this paper we present our arguments for fostering Computational Thinking skills using a Blocks Programming Environment augmented with a Tangible User Interface, namely by exploiting objects whose interactions with the physical environment are mapped to digital actions performed on the system. Our demonstration includes a working prototype implementing our Tangible Blocks Programming Environment called TAPAS.},

  abstract={While in the workplace are highly demanded work-related awareness of computing and information technology, this discipline does not have sufficient and accurate dissemination, especially in schools. New technologies have positioned more as a communication tool than as a means for building innovative products. On the other hand, it has missed the application of own abilities in the area, such as the development of logical reasoning, algorithmic thinking and problem solving, both the school curriculum as well as in instances of informal learning of students. In literature and on the web, there are tools that are accessible by both self-study students to be used as a complement to other activities. However, these tools seek the development of computational thinking itself, and not within a broader framework, which allows to present the computer science as an area of professional development, for example, inserted in a context where should solve problems requiring support programming and algorithms. Problock is proposed as a tool to (1) develop computational thinking, in a context of learning based on addiction problems, (2) disseminate and motivate students for future professional development in higher education in computer science and disciplines related. In this paper, the results of the construction of the tool are presented and the work in progress in a Chilean school.},

Analysis of the source code and evaluation of the answers to the exercises are carried out using high performance computing to improve the response time of the system. This preliminary work will contribute to a robust method for automated exam scoring, which is expected to assess and support the development of computational thinking among students.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) gained significant importance in education, leading to a surge in the development of dedicated instructional platforms. The cultivation of students’ CT skills posed a challenge, often involving the introduction of abstract and challenging-to-visualize programming concepts. This study aimed to bridge this gap by introducing an augmented reality-based coding game—an interactive learning platform designed to facilitate students in acquiring programming skills and enhancing their grasp of computational thinking concepts. The augmented reality (AR) digital game is specifically directed towards fundamental CT skills, such as pattern recognition, decomposition, abstraction, and developing algorithms. To evaluate the effectiveness of the AR game in enhancing CT skills, a study was conducted with 124 middle school students, entailing in grades 6th and 8th. The experimental group (N = 63) utilized the AR game, while the control group (N = 61) relied on conventional text materials. The findings of the experiment strongly supported the integration of AR technology along with game-based learning as a means to enhance CT knowledge and skills while simultaneously reducing cognitive load.},

This study compared the effects of using two kinds of robots- Dash & Dot and LEGO NXT, in terms of students' performance, student's attitudes about learning activities, and how different genders respond to various robots. A Quasi-Experimental Design was conducted. The participants consisted of 106 6th graders from four classes of students. Two classes were designated as the experimental groups which used Dash & Dot robots,). The other two classes of students were the control groups which used NXT robots. With respect to students' attitudes toward learning, the study showed no significant difference between experimental and control groups. With respect to learning programming skills, it was found that females in the experimental group prefer to use robots. Females showed a definite preference for using the Dash & Dot robots.},

Therefore, how to effectively improve girls' CT has become a serious concern. This study integrated two types of project-based learning (PBL) into a Scratch programming course, one with extensive teacher-supported scaffolding and the other with limited teacher-supported scaffolding. To examine their impact on girls' CT skills and self-efficacy, this study applied mixed research methods, conducted a pretest-posttest control group experiment, and analyzed the quantitative and qualitative data collected from 21 grade-3 girls in a primary school. It was found that the extensive teacher-supported scaffolding of PBL in a Scratch programming course is more effective in promoting the CT skills and self-efficacy than limited teacher-supported scaffolding of PBL. These findings have some implications for the effective PBL practice and related teacher professional development.},

  abstract={During training at the Complementary Formation Program (CFP), Colombian primary school teachers do not acquire Computational Thinking (CT) skills, which are considered fundamental for the knowledge economies of the 21st century. In this paper, we describe the early stages of a project aiming to reform the CFP curriculum, such that CT skills becomes an integral part. As a first step, we carried-out four introductory workshops with 64 first-and third-semester CFP students and then surveyed them to gather their perceptions on CT. The results show that the students have a limited understanding of CT and its associated skills, but they recognize their importance. Moreover, they agree that primary school should be the starting point to develop them. The project will continue gathering information from current CFP teachers, current primary school teachers, and university professors who are experts in curriculum development, to develop the curricular proposal.},

  abstract={Software talents should have the engineering ability, a common sense in IT industry, which is characterized by the fact that design plays a very important role in software engineering. Basis on the enhancement of computational thinking, the reform ideas of the development of the student's engineering ability are introduced. The detailed approaches include: 1) Extraction of fundamental discipline concept of engineering ability development; 2) Problem solving-centered organization of courses of software development tools; 3) Initiate the courses of software engineering as soon as possible; 4) Continual training of abstract logical thinking for the purpose of software abstract thinking.},

  abstract={In regular basic education environments, one of the challenges of Computer and Computing courses or similar is to motivate students, who perceive programming as a difficult task. Arduino board is recognized as a tool to improve programming skills and to facilitate teamwork. In this paper, Computational Thinking is evaluated through concepts, practices and computational perspectives of the activities carried out with the Arduino board by the 5th-grade students of secondary education of the “José Obrero” Parochial Technical Educational Institution in the district of San Mateo from the province of Huarochirí of Lima region.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking (CT) is a way to structure thinking to solve problems, which develops cognitive skills. Educational Digital Games (EDG) are a potential tool to work with CT, stimulating the student's interest and learning. Still, to make these games playable by children with Intellectual disabilities (ID), it is necessary to have adaptations suitable to their educational needs. Therefore, this paper presents the development and evaluation of the EDG “Pensar e Vestir” (PeV). This game addresses a daily life activity, the process of choosing clothes and the act of wearing them, and aims to promote the development of CT in children both neurotypical and with ID. The development process was supported by ID, Education, and Specialized Education Treatment specialists based on accessibility guidelines. In the end, there were two evaluations, firstly with the specialists and then with Computation students, to validate the functional and technical requirements. Currently, the game is in evaluation by its target audience.},
