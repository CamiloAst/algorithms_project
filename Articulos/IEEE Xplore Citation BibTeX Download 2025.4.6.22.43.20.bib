  abstract={This research-to-practice full paper describes K-12 Diversity and Broadening Participation through the integration of Computational Thinking (CT) across the curriculum. CT is implicit within the current high school curriculum and used by teachers and students every day in their classrooms across multiple content areas. Most students are unaware they are using these skills and that these skills are the foundation of learning computer science. Over a series of workshops, high school teachers and students, and university faculty discussed the need to incorporate CT skills throughout the high school curriculum to improve those skills in students and to impart a better understanding of computer science. The result was a guide created to assist high school teachers to make CT concepts explicit in their classes. A main component of the guide includes specific examples of how to incorporate CT skills in various content areas. The guide was created on a foundation of cultural relevance and cogenerative dialogues. Here we describe salient points about the creation of the guide and insights gained during these workshops.},

  abstract={The objective of this work is focused on the definition of a methodology for the development of computational thinking and the subsequent measurement of the development obtained in the students. The methodological proposal includes specific tasks or activities to develop computational thinking as well as tests that allow analyzing the extent to which computational thinking or skills related to problem solving have been developed in a scientific, specific, or even general or of practical application in situations of daily life. Once the methodological framework was defined, we proceeded to develop a computer tool that provides global support for the implementation of this methodology. The implemented platform has a simple and intuitive design that allows an easy use of it since it is aimed at pre-university students and teachers who necessarily do not have advanced knowledge of Computer Science. Finally, the platform automatically provides progress reports and course development, including statistical data by age or gender, among others.},

  abstract={Technologies for development have great potential in accelerating the socio-economic progress of disadvantaged communities. But these technologies are usually developed by people removed from the daily realities of fieldwork. This paper explores the need and the possibilities of educating rural populations and social workers on the use of technology to create their own digital artifacts. We discuss two workshops, one for villagers in the state of Telangana and the second one for graduate students of a university social work department exploring the use of MIT's Scratch software as a tool for assisting in social interventions. We also discuss the results of an acceptability study among the social work students to gauge the potential for such a tool to be used in the field.},

  abstract={Computational thinking assessment is an important part of testing the effectiveness of computational thinking cultivation. However, the existing computational thinking assessments still suffer from the problem of insufficient examination of non-cognitive factors, leading to the lack of validity of its assessment results. Since the iceberg model can comprehensively and deeply explore individual characteristics, this paper draws on the division idea of the model and divides computational thinking into explicit computational thinking the basic knowledge required to solve problems using computational thinking and implicit computational thinking the internal psychological characteristics of individuals in the process of using computational thinking. A comprehensive assessment framework of computational thinking is constructed, which contains five dimensions: knowledge and skills, self-efficacy, internet attitude, learning motivation, and thinking style. Finally, its application in the hierarchical teaching of computational thinking and suggestions for personalized teaching programs are given in order to promote the development of personalized education in computational thinking.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking (CT) is a fundamental skill that is not only confined to computer scientists’ activities but can be widely applied in daily life and is required in order to adapt to the future and, therefore, should be taught at early ages. Within this framework, assessing CT is an indispensable part to consider in order to introduce CT in the school curricula. Nevertheless, efforts involving the formal assessment of computational thinking has primarily focused on middle school grades and above; and are mostly based on the analysis of projects in specific programming environments. A Beginners Computational Thinking Test (BCTt), aimed at early ages, and based on the Computational Thinking Test [1], has been designed including several improvements; submitted to a content validation process through expert´s judgement procedure; and administered to Primary School students. The BCTt design is considered adequate by experts and results show a high reliability for the assessment of CT in Primary School, particularly in first educational stages.},

Blended learning may promote the developments of computational thinking on students. The paper takes the junior College students as the experimental objects, and carries a pretest-posttest study through unequal experimental and control groups. It approved that blended learning has a positive impact on the college student's computational thinking, i.e., they have an obvious progress.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking is an essential skill for all students in the 21st Century. A fundamental question is how can we create computer affordances to empower novice teachers and students, in a variety of STEM and art disciplines, to think computationally while avoiding difficult overhead emerging from traditional coding? Over the last 20 years we have iteratively developed tools that aim to support computational thinking. As these tools evolved a philosophy emerged to support Computational Thinking by joining human abilities with computer affordances. Chief among these findings is that supporting Computational Thinking is much more than making coding accessible. Computational Thinking Tools aim to minimize coding overhead by supporting users through three fundamental stages of the Computational Thinking development cycle: problem formulation, solution expression, and solution execution/evaluation.},

  year={2024},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={This research article assesses the concepts of Computational Thinking (CT) as applied in basic education. Although widely used in K12 education, many articles indicate a lack of uniformity in the conceptualization of CT. CT is defined as the systematic problem-solving ability based on algorithmic processes. It is seen as crucial for stimulating interest and diversity in STEM careers. Effective CT teaching requires precise conceptualization and appropriate teaching techniques. With the world's increasing digitization, CT is considered as fundamental as reading or math skills and should be taught from K12 education. This article reports a systematic mapping of CT con-cepts applied in K12 activities, reflecting on the chosen activities and teaching techniques. Despite some articles highlighting the unclear definition of CT, there is a notable agreement on its key concepts. The study used the IEEEXplore database, analyzing primary articles from 2019–2023. The findings reveal a high degree of similarity in CT concepts, indicating a trend towards standardization. A catalog of frequently cited activities used to teach CT is presented, aiding teachers in introducing CT in their classes. This study supports the development of teaching policies and initiatives. contributing to STEM interest and diversity.},

  abstract={This research study presents our work focused on studying the development of introductory computational thinking in undergraduate biomedical engineering students. In response to the growing computational intensity of the healthcare industry, biomedical engineering (BME) undergraduate education is starting to emphasize computation and computational thinking. Computational thinking is a way of thinking that uses concepts and methodologies of computing to solve problems in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary subjects. In broader terms, computational thinking is not only associated with using computational tools but also with the thought process of solving a problem by data representation, problem decomposition, and algorithm design. Despite being so important, there is little research work or information available on the development of computational thinking in BME undergraduate students. Our research focuses on how BME undergraduate students develop computational thinking skills while performing group activities related to problem-solving. In order to conduct this study, we incorporate a teaching methodology that prompts computational thinking in a thermodynamics course being taught at a public mid-western university to approximately 120 sophomore students. We observe classroom activities involving analytical problem solving followed by pseudo code generation for computational coding. In order to investigate computational thinking, we collect classroom observations of small groups of students as they come up with a solution to an analytical problem with each other. We complement the observation notes of the classroom activities with follow up semi structured interviews with individual students from five groups. Thematic analysis of the student interviews is used in order to analyze student responses towards the incorporation of computation intensive teaching methodology. This Work in Progress helps us expand our understanding of computational thinking development and the challenges involved in performing computational thinking activity in BME undergraduate students.},

  volume={},

  pages={1-4},
  abstract={This work-in-progress research-to-practice paper presents an intervention on integrating computational thinking modules into a software engineering course. The national consensus on the significance of computational thinking has prompted the expansion of related educational initiatives over the past decade. Since the definition of computational thinking by Wing in 2006, this concept has gained significant attention within the educational community. Particularly this surge of interest has led to extensive research into its conceptual foundations and subsequent integration into educational curricula since 2013. National initiatives have since emerged to incorporate computational thinking into the educational system. Furthermore, as artificial intelligence and computing systems become increasingly integrated into daily life, there is a growing demand from industries for a workforce and graduates adept at critical thinking and problem-solving. Aligned with this national movement, our study presents a two-year institutional initiative, aimed at integrating computational thinking into the software engineering program. The software engineering discipline extensively involves design thinking and problem-solving skills. However, we noticed that these higher-level skills are not imparted early in the program to teach students this method of thinking and approaching problems. To bridge this skill gap, we developed a set of computational thinking modules and integrated them into a gateway course in the software engineering program. Over two years, we implemented this intervention in an introductory-level course and evaluated its impact on students' computational thinking skills by analyzing their responses to a standard Computational Thinking Assessment survey. The results showed significant improvement in most components. These early findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating these computational thinking modules into the gateway courses, regardless of the specific course topic. A notable feature of these modules is their adaptability to diverse engineering courses, suggesting broader applicability across disciplines. Moving forward, our research aims to expand the integration of the computational thinking modules into various courses in other institutes across the nation and analyze their impact on student performance.},

  abstract={This study attempted to investigate elementary school teachers' understandings, beliefs, and intentions toward STEM and Computational Thinking. We collected data through a survey of 16 teachers at one elementary school in Malang City, Indonesia. They represented a variety of subjects with diverse learning experiences. The survey took place after the respondents received a short training about STEM and Computational Thinking. Quantitative analysis showed that most elementary school teachers positively demonstrated Computational Thinking practices in their schools. Besides, they believed that Computational Thinking could help students think logically, structurally, and creatively, while STEM helped train students to be problem solvers in an analytical, critical, and practical way. In addition, most respondents intended to continue learning and applying STEM and Computational Thinking approaches in their learning design. Added to this, the participants' understanding of STEM and Computational Thinking also improved based on the results of the Wilcoxon test conducted on the pre-test and post-test. This study provides valuable information on the need for elementary teacher development programs, namely improving teachers' teaching skills based on STEM and Computational Thinking for preparing students with 21 st-century learning skills.},

  abstract={Physiological computing (PC) technology is becoming increasingly popular as wearable hardware improves. However, little is known regarding potential connections between hands-on experience with physiological computing technology and computation thinking perspectives. This is particularly true for black communities. Applications for physiological computing include systems such as wearable technology (e.g., Apple Watch) capable of mapping students' physiological activity to various outputs. The work discussed in this paper presents our initial steps toward filling these gaps. In particular, we share our observations of computational thinking perspectives that emerged while black high school students constructed simple programs driven by near real-time brain wave information. Our findings suggest interactive physiological data may lead to unique computational perspectives during learning activities.},

  abstract={A significant aspect of computational thinking is as a way of reasoning about the world in terms of data. This mindset channels number-crunching toward an ambition to discover knowledge through logic, models and simulations. Here we show how computational cognitive science can be used to reconstruct and analyse the structure of computational thinking mindsets (forma mentis in Latin) through complex networks. As a case study, we investigate cognitive networks tied to key concepts of computational thinking provided by (i) 159 high school students enrolled in a science curriculum and (ii) 59 researchers in complex systems and simulations. Researchers' reconstructed knowledge highlighted a positive mindset about scientific modelling, semantically framing data and simulations as ways of discovering nature. Students correctly identified different aspects of logic reasoning but perceived ‘computation’ as a distressing, anxiety-eliciting task, framed with math jargon and lacking links to real-world discovery. Students' mindsets around ‘data’, ‘model’ and ‘simulations’ critically revealed no awareness of numerical modelling as a way for understanding the world. Our findings provide evidence of a crippled computational thinking mindset in students, who acquire mathematical skills that are not channelled toward real-world discovery through coding. This unlinked knowledge ends up being perceived as distressing number-crunching expertise with no relevant outcome. The virtuous mindset of researchers reported here indicates that computational thinking can be restored by training students specifically in coding, modelling and simulations in relation to discovering nature. Our approach opens innovative ways for quantifying computational thinking and enhancing its development through mindset reconstruction.},

  abstract={Most efforts to incorporate computational thinking in K-12 education use visual tools (e.g., Scratch) and focus on students in their first grades. Fewer projects investigate the development of computational thinking in students in the last years of school, who usually have not had early formal preparation to acquire these skills. This study provides evidence of the effectiveness of teaching C++ (a low-level programming language) to develop computational thinking in high school students in Chile. By applying a test before and after a voluntary C++ workshop, the results reveal a significant improvement in computational thinking after the workshop. However, we observe that there was a tendency to drop out of the workshop among students with lower levels of initial computational thinking. Besides, tenth-grade students obtained lower final scores than eleventh and twelfth-grade students. These results indicate that teaching a low-level programming language is useful, but it has high entry-barriers.},

  abstract={In this paper, the existing problems and teaching characteristics of VB programming are first analyzed. Then the specific measures to reform the teaching and examination modes are proposed in accordance with the requirements of computational thinking ability training. After that, how to train the students' “computational thinking” in the VB program curriculum is elaborated on, in the hope of enabling the students to analyze and solve problems and to innovate with computers.},

  abstract={To better understand the impact of students' personality on their computational thinking (CT), this paper develops a CT evaluation tool for college students. Correlation analysis is used to explore the relationship between students' computational thinking skills (CTS) and their five personality traits: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. 219 college students completed the CT Assessment Test and the Big Five Personality Inventory. The results showed that there were statistically significant correlations between CTS and extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness, among which openness had the greatest impact on CTS, and extraversion and conscientiousness had moderate effects on CTS. These results are consistent with the conclusions of most related literatures, confirming the existence of non-cognitive influencing factors of CT. Based on these findings, this paper recommends that teachers can pay attention to the individual differences of students from the perspective of personality, and provide them with suitable education to comprehensively improve students' CTS.},

  abstract={This paper introduces the notion of predicting academic performance based on Computational Thinking. The integral role that Computational Thinking modalities play in engineering disciplines can serve as an accurate indicator of the student future academic success. Therefore, this study investigated the students' performance in a Computational Thinking course offered at the freshman level to predict student academic success. To achieve this goal, a two-year study of the correlation between the students' accumulative grade point averages and their grades obtained in this course was conducted. The performance of nine hundred and eighty two students in forty sections was assessed over the two-year period. It was concluded that the students' future academic performance is strongly correlated to their Computational Thinking skills assessed at the freshman level. This clearly suggests the viability of using Computational Thinking skills as a fairly accurate predictor of students' academic success. These results have also implied that the assessment of Computational Thinking can be used as an early intervention tool to improve the students' retention, progression, and graduation rates in STEM related disciplines.},

  abstract={The promotion of computational thinking education has become a worldwide trend. To cultivate the computational thinking ability of children at young age, many computational thinking board games have appeared recently. This article introduces five computational thinking board games, including Robot Turtles, King of Pirates, Doggy Code, ROBOT WARS Coding Board Game, and Code master, and then to analyze its characteristics respectively. Additionally, this article also points out the current limitations and challenges of computational thinking board games. We hope more schools or operators will join the development of computational thinking education in the future.},
