  abstract={Observations have shown the need of adequate collaboration among the engineering educators for effective achievement of its goals. Nevertheless, there have been reports of the inadequate relationship among engineering educators. Consequently, it is vital to develop strategies to boost the synergy among the parties. Computational Thinking (CT) could be a dependable approach. This paper presents ways of ensuring synergy among engineering educators through computational thinking. A questionnaire survey that sought information from the respondents on the ways computational thinking: promotes thinking abilities, reduces personal clashes, and improves decision-making process among the engineering educators was administered to 400 respondents. 348 survey answers were returned, found reliable and used in the data analysis. The analysis revealed that computational thinking plays vital roles in the repositioning of engineering education for solving of novel problems, assurance of mutual respect among educators, and intensive research for renown engineering education with relative contribution index above 0.8. The paper recommends the development of a computational thinking based comprehensive engineering educators' synergy framework as a suggestion for future research.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is considered an important skillset for 21st century learners and became a subject of focus in K-12 education in the recent years. It cultivates problem-solving and algorithmic thinking and can be helpful in wider aspects of everyday life, besides programming and computer science. There have been various approaches to teach computational thinking in early education stages that utilize modern technologies, such as physical computing and robotics, and adopt a playful manner. Mobile Augmented Reality is a promising technology along this path that lets users collaborate and interact with both physical and digital elements. However, the technology is still relatively new and has not been studied extensively with students, especially in formal educational settings. In this paper we present ARQuest, a collaborative mobile augmented reality game for developing computational thinking skills of primary school students. The game combines a physical board and tangible tokens with animated 3D content, and students use them to create and solve challenges in a gamified environment. We have performed an exploratory study in two primary schools in order to explore the impact of ARQuest on students' understanding of algorithmic concepts, engagement and collaboration. The study led to a number of interesting conclusions regarding the game, as well as more generic aspects of interacting and collaborating in mobile augmented reality.},

  abstract={The purpose of this study is to design a computational thinking curriculum standard for K-12 education. The Delphi technique was employed to collect different views and derive consensus from a panel of thirteen experts, including computer scientists, computer science educators, K-12 computer teachers, and industry experts. The first draft of Delphi survey questionnaire, consisting of nine themes (problem solving, problem decomposition, algorithms, data representation, data analysis, modeling and simulation, abstraction, automation, and others) and 60 competence indicators, was developed based on our investigation of the nature of computational thinking. After three rounds of survey and a final round-table discussion, the expert panel derived 49 essential competence indicators (13 for grades K to 6, nine for grades 7 to 9 and 27 of grades 10 to 12) and eight optional competence indicators (one for grades 7 to 9 and seven for grades 10 to 12). According to the results, the core ability and training of computational thinking are different in grades. In grades K to 6, students develop logical thinking and problem solving skills in personal and family life. In grades 7 to 9, students must understand the basic concepts of programming and write basic programs. Finally, in grades 10 to 12, they will use high-level skills to apply the concepts of abstraction, modeling, and structured problem decomposition to solve problems in different fields. The results serve as useful references for developing Taiwan's new K-12 computing curriculum.},

  abstract={This paper is focused on the teaching/learning process of Computational Thinking at primary and secondary schools. It is generally accepted that Programming is a complex task that requires a long learning process. Theoretical knowledge about fundamentals on algorithms and data structures, as well as, on programming languages are required but are not enough; practicing a lot is also necessary. However, teaching Computer Programming is a hard job, most of the times unsuccessful. To overcome all the difficulties, felt by teachers and students, an increasingly bigger community of researchers in Computer Science is defending the importance of teaching Computational Thinking to young students to train them, since very earlier, in logic and abstract reasoning for problem solving. Our starting point to approach this topic relies on the use of an Ontology (OntoCnE) that describes in detail the concepts “Computational Thinking” and “Programming”, and maps those concepts to different education levels, starting with the first year. We believe that a person just acquires a new way of thinking, or a new way of behaving, if he is trained with the appropriate learning resources. So a main investment to educate people in Computational Thinking is on the choice/creation of those convenient resources. In particular we intended to investigate the impact of Augmented Reality in the usefulness of the referred resources. In that direction we will also discuss the development of a Web Platform to help on collecting and classifying (according to the referred ontology) learning resources to be used by teachers in computing classes. On the other hand, the platform will help on the retrieval, from that repository, of the most adequate resources to teach a specific subject to a specific level.},

  pages={349-353},
  abstract={Game design environments are traditionally used as means for engaging non-programmers in the learning process. However, these environments lack specific support for teaching computational thinking to novices. Typically, such skills are acquired in ad hoc practical sessions with supervision provided by teachers or peers. The usual scenario is where a teacher guides the students in solving these problems during a game design session. In informal learning settings, step-by-step tutorials for creating existing games are used to compensate for the lack of computer support for solving design and computational problems. In this paper we suggest a game design process that combines support for computational thinking with tool usage, by identifying the most common computational thinking problems and providing a generic solution to them. We have evaluated our solution in the context of AgentWeb, an online cloud-based game design environment for novices. We discuss how to incorporate suggested computational thinking solutions as computer assistant into the game design user interface.},

  abstract={The role of computing in society is fundamental for the political, economic and cultural development of countries, especially in a globalized context. Computational thinking is an extremely important skill in the education of young students, since the ability of intuitively abstracting information and knowledge promotes an expansion of the learning dimension. This study aims to gather approaches used for teaching computational thinking exclusively to high school students, highlighting their performance and motivation resulting from the applications of such approaches. In order to answer our research question, a systematic mapping of the analysis of 15 studies was conducted. The use of computer programming proved to be the most used way to disseminate computational thinking. The students who participated in approaches regarding the insertion of computational thinking in the classroom showed positive impact on the development of classroom activities, as well as motivation to learn.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is a crucial skill for students to analyze and solve problems, and programming education serves as an important pathway to cultivate computational thinking. This study combines relevant literature and utilizes Scratch, a visual programming software, to construct a gamified teaching model for Scratch courses. A quasi-experimental research design was employed, involving two fifth-grade classes from a primary school in K city. The study employed methods such as analysis of student works, SPSS scale data analysis, and student interviews to investigate the impact of gamified teaching in Scratch courses on developing elementary students' computational thinking. The results indicate that gamified teaching in Scratch courses significantly enhances the computational thinking level of elementary students, particularly in the dimensions of critical thinking, problem-solving ability, and algorithmic thinking. Based on the research findings, it is recommended that gamified teaching in Scratch courses should involve appropriate teaching tools, incorporate game-based learning, emphasize problem-solving, encourage collaborative learning, and provide training for educators competent in programming education.},

In this sense, Computational Thinking, as a problem-solving approach that can involve information technologies, can contribute a lot to this subject. Therefore, due to its essence, the development of Computer Science concepts is closely related to the employment of problem-solving activities. However, teachers may face difficulties when proposing Computational Thinking problem-solving activities to their students. This paper proposes the engineering of a software that aims to allow teachers to generate challenges related to game and interactive animations programming to support their classes. The problems generated by the system, do not limit the learners' creative power. Besides that, teachers can balance the reasoning component of the challenges according to the learners' level of knowledge in programming and algorithms. An experiment with Computational Thinking workshops was analyzed in order to design the proposed software.},

Many primary and secondary schools adopt graphical programming as an important way for students' computational thinking development. However, elementary school students have less self-control in learning and are more dependent on teachers, so timely and effective teaching interaction is an important guarantee for the realization of the teaching goals of graphical programming. Through three rounds of action research, the essay investigated the impact of teaching interaction strategies on the development of students' computational thinking. The findings show that students are satisfied with the designed interaction strategies, and the interaction strategies can significantly improve students' computational thinking ability and level.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is the systematic approach of defining a problem and crafting its solution. It employs computer programming algorithms to address scientific, engineering, and mathematical challenges using programming languages. Feedback plays a pivotal role in the learning journey of computational thinking. It is widely recognized that offering timely feedback to students on their computational endeavors significantly contributes to their achievement and overall satisfaction with the course. This research explores the implementation of an automated feedback system designed to evaluate and offer early feedback on computer engineering projects. The aim is to integrate best practices and software tools related to computational thinking into the thinking and learning processes within an engineering curriculum. Preliminary findings suggest that the automated feedback system enhances students' computational skills and improves their performance in the course. We anticipate that the insights gained from this research will inform the enhancement of curricula and course evaluations across different computational thinking tasks, disciplines, and courses.},

  abstract={Computational thinking refers to thinking and solving issues in the same way as computer scientists do. This study aims to evaluate the computational thinking skills of prospective elementary teachers. This study uses a quantitative descriptive research method. The research instrument uses a computational thinking skills test containing four indicators, namely decomposition, algorithm, pattern recognition, abstraction/generalization. The subjects of this study were 244 prospective elementary teachers from a Study Program of Elementary School Teacher Education at a public university in Pekanbaru, Riau, Indonesia. The results of this study indicate that the computational thinking skills of prospective elementary teachers are in the moderate category. Among the four indicators, prospective elementary teachers’ skills of decomposition and pattern recognition are higher than algorithm and abstraction/generalization.},

  abstract={Cognitive testing is concerned with quantitative and qualitative evaluation of an individual's intellectual functioning in its broad sense. Tests for evaluating cognitive components are based on submitting the subject to a given task and then assessing performance according to an established set of reference parameters. In order to analyze subject's behavior and test results, a software tool was developed based upon digital ink technology, which permits the digitalization of the assessment procedure, from the undertaking of the test to the production of the assessment results. By doing so, the test procedure is computerized and its data is saved in InkML format and processed to analyze tasks previously defined by the evaluator. We have used this tool to develop a Computational Thinking test defined within the Cattell-Horn-Carroll CHC framework of intelligence. Further investigating the relationship between fluid intelligence and computational thinking allows a better understanding of the main set of cognitive skills which need to be developed by students and professionals that aim to work in this domain. Moreover, it is suggested that assessments, independent of their context, may benefit from using the InkML tool, mainly due to the richer set of information that can be collected.},

  abstract={This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents the development and implementation of an innovative online adaptive gamification platform for learning Computational Thinking (CT). CT is an essential problem-solving skill set in this modern era of digitization and technological advancements. To build students' knowledge and skills in CT while maximizing students' motivation and engagement in learning, a novel online adaptive gamified course called Computational Thinking Quest (CTQ) was introduced. The CTQ was designed and developed by a multidisciplinary team of students and faculty members. The key features of CTQ are (1) an interactive storyline with animated avatars, mini-games, and questions created using Unity three-dimensional cross-platform game engine and Blockly block-based visual programming language; (2) questions at three different levels of difficulty for effective adaptive and self-learning approach; (3) an answer and feedback to each question for increased students' confidence and enthusiasm towards learning; (4) hyperlinks to online learning resources for further reading; (5) a badge and a leaderboard to motivate active participation and encourage success; and (6) a course management system with automatic data saving capability to enable learning at own pace, anytime, anywhere. The CTQ was rolled out to some newly matriculated first-year undergraduate Engineering (ENG) and InfoComm Technology (ICT) students. A total of 54 ENG and 53 ICT students' learning performance and feedback were collated and analyzed. Statistical results from the paired Student's t-test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test consistently reveal that (1) the median of post-test marks is significantly higher than that of pre-test marks (p < 0.001); (2) the median of CT knowledge scores after taking CTQ is significantly higher than that of before CTQ (p < 0.001); and (3) the median time taken to complete the post-test is significantly lower than the pre-test (p < 0.001). Furthermore, more than 75% of ENG and ICT students, separately, stated that CTQ is an engaging or very engaging learning platform; 81% of them indicated that the educational content of CTQ is enriching or very enriching; and 83% of them commented that CTQ has motivated independent learning. The CTQ can also serve as a bridging course to narrow the heterogeneity gap among students with heterogeneous prior knowledge on computer programming languages and ease students into programming-related modules, thereby enhancing teaching and learning effectiveness.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking (CT) is an essential skill in digital society. With the growing momentum in integrating CT into K-12 education, a higher need can be seen in developing proper assessment tools to measure what students have learned about CT. Although numerous attempts have been made to design CT assessment tools, there is a scarcity of well-validated tests for summative assessment aimed at lower primary students. To bridge this gap, we designed the Computational Thinking Test for Lower Primacy (CTt-LP), targeting students aged 6–8. This study presents the test design, content validation, and pilot testing. For test design, Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) was applied, and four constructs were selected. A total of 30 items were designed, after which content validation was performed via expert judgement and cognitive interviews with students. Revisions were made based on the validation results. The pilot testing was conducted in a public primary school in northern China, with 72 participants from Grade 2. Results indicate that the test is balanced regarding the difficulty level for the target group. Item analysis was conducted for each item, based on which decisions about the refinement of the test were made. Directions for future research are discussed.},
