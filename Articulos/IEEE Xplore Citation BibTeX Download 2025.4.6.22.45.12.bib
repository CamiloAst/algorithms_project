  abstract={While there has been a rising interest in computational thinking (CT) and a push to include it into the K-12 curriculum, there is little empirical evidence that a class that teaches CT will have any measurable long-term effects on student performance. Using robotics as an example of CT instruction, I propose to examine a high school that has had a large number of robotics students over the past six years to find evidence for the long-term benefits of CT. I will analyze school records (e.g. STEM class enrollment, STEM test scores, SAT scores) for differences between robotics and non-robotics students and compare interviews with selected students.},

  abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) refers to a group of life-long conditions that are characterized by qualitative impairments in social interactions, problem solving and constructive skills. Children with learning disabilities such as autism face challenges in generating suitable and optimal solutions to problems. Those challenges can severely affect their interactions with others. Thus, teaching children with ASD problem solving and computational thinking skills could help them resolve conflicts that may happen in their everyday life. Effective problem solving is critical for their academic and social success and since one of the most effective tools for teaching children with autism is through using visual aids, the work in this paper reports the design and implementation of a serious game that aims at cultivating problem solving skills and teaching programming concepts to children with ASD. The presented game is suitable for children 7 to 14 years of age diagnosed with ASD to learn programming concepts. The preliminary prototype for the game gained positive responses from experts and 12 children with ASD from Caritas Egypt association and Hope Academy.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper presents our experience of positive outcomes with increased motivation and retention in teaching an introductory Computer Science course with Python programming. Without reinventing the wheel, we infused few well established pedagogies by integrating and evaluating Computational Thinking (CT) skills in a meaningful way. We integrated CT with existing curriculum alongside programming and teaching general problem-solving techniques with a flowchart-based programming environment and without using specific programming concepts or languages at the beginning. Our aim here is not only to teach a programming language per se, but also to teach, at the beginning, the different ways of problem solving, logical reasoning, algorithm design, and programming constructs with minimal or no emphasis on syntax. A positive learning experience is successfully developed for our students by using appropriate pedagogies and strategies. To evaluate the impact of this infusion, a pre- and post-survey as well as a pre- and post-CT test were conducted on student cohort in different sections. The statistical analysis of the survey and test results show evidence of improvement in student's problem solving and coding skills as well as increase in motivation towards programming.},

  abstract={Block-oriented programming environments, such as Scratch and AppInventor, have become mainstream and have helped introduce non-programmers to algorithmic thinking; that is, to computational thinking (CT) skills. In various experiments, referenced in this paper, we observed how objects (tangibles) augmented with digital properties - that is, tangible user interface (TUI) objects - can help develop CT skills. We investigate which paradigm can be used to introduce CT skills with TUIs. By drawing on past experience, we conclude that block-oriented programming provides a suitable answer to our research questions. Furthermore, we introduce a framework for implementing block-oriented programmable objects that we believe can help end-users learn CT skills.},

  abstract={Various didactic strategies to develop Computational Thinking (CT) skills have been successful in terms of student engagement and educational outcomes. However, monitoring the learning progress of students is still a hurdle to teachers and researchers. In this context, we explore the use of self-organizing maps for analyzing games produced in a game building workshop offered simultaneously to technical education students in Brazil and to undergraduate students in Computer Engineering in Chile. Metrics from seven CT features present in the games were extracted with the Dr. Scratch tool and used as an input in the training process. The results allowed a clustering analysis considering the identified features and the correlation between learning behaviors. The organization of the map reflected a progressive skill acquisition identified by features present in the developed games. Also, it could be identified that students of both educational levels reached similar levels of CT skill development.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking (CT) is considered a necessary 21st-century competence that should be introduced to school education as a vital ingredient. However, the lack of a consensual definition of CT and the confusion with other similar terms made it a big challenge for researchers and practitioners to understand this concept. The purpose of this work-in-progress (WIP) is to identify and compare the existing definitions of CT proposed by various members of the education or research community, and ultimately to give educators and researchers suggestions on understanding this concept for particular purposes or situations. We conducted a systematic review of the definitions of CT from the source of academic articles and categorized the definitions based on their approaches, dimensions, and contexts. Forty-one unique and original concepts were extracted from the search. Results indicate that the existing definitions of CT were mostly formulated 1) with a prototype approach, 2) for the generic purpose of use, 3) in the context of K-12 education, 4) based on the subject of Computer Science. These results provide sufficient granularity to allow us to come up with suggestions on how to choose appropriate and pragmatic CT definitions.},

  abstract={Broadening participation and increasing equity in computer science (CS) have been goals of the computing field for decades. Initiatives seeking to increase access to CS have led to an increase in elementary schools teaching computational thinking (CT), but students are often instructed by classroom teachers who have no formal training in CT or CS. Our project prepares in-service and pre-service elementary teachers to integrate CT into their science lessons. While our overall goal was to increase CT access for all students, we found some teachers enacted CT in ways that did not always provide equal access to all students. Although our professional development adopted a CS for All approach, without explicit supports, a group of teachers implemented CT in ways often upholding the current trends of inequity and power structures within CS. Our findings suggest teachers would benefit from explicit support to provide opportunities for students currently underrepresented in CS and to offer more equitable opportunities to students regardless of their CS background.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) concept is a problem-solving approach that includes logical ordering, analyzing data and preparing solutions with the help of different visualization tools like flowcharts, graphs, pie charts etc. CT is not just used by computer programmer, but it can also be used by students and teachers in any classroom so that teaching learning process becomes successful. CT is an important element for the expansion of computer software, along with providing the huge support to problem solving skills across all disciplines of education like engineering, science, humanities and K12 education. It gives a logical idea to the students to solve a problem systematically using algorithm development, flowchart design and programming and problem-solving skills. CT increases the confidence among students in dealing with complexity of difficult problems, the capacity to handle complex issues and collaborate with others to find a shared purpose or solution. In this research paper, authors discuss the impact of CT among the students of different specialization of engineering and K12 by using different problem-solving techniques and strategies such as modeling, making sub goals, pruning and searching so that students will be able to think differently towards new problems.},

  abstract={With the worldwide momentum of promoting computational thinking (CT) education, greater attention has been received on assessing learning effects in both cognitive and attitudinal aspects. However, the cross-lagged relations between the two were unknown. This study investigated the cross-lagged association between CT cognitive performance and attitudinal beliefs of primary students through a three-wave longitudinal design. The paper reported the first two waves of data collection, with an 8-month time interval, involving a sample of 392 students (age 9-11). At each wave, students were asked to complete a CT cognitive test and a self-reported attitude survey. Through cross-lagged analyses, the results showed that prior CT cognitive performance significantly predicted later learning attitudes, and the paths remained significant after controlling for students’ demographics and learning experiences. The study contributes to the literature by pioneering documenting the cross-lagged relations between students’ cognitive and attitudinal attainments in the context of CT education.},

  abstract={As Computational Thinking (CT) becomes an increasingly necessary skill, it is crucial to examine how CT can be taught in the classroom. Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) is a practical concept to examine how CT education can be developed. This systematic literature review presents the discussion of K-8 teachers’ PCK in the implementation of CT- related activities in the classroom. Studies were extracted from Google Scholar’s database. Among these studies, 14 articles were deemed to be relevant for a more in-depth examination. Findings from this preliminary literature review suggest that teachers have clear purposes and goals for teaching CT and various instructional strategies for teaching CT. However, the existing studies lacked information about teachers’ knowledge and beliefs regarding the methods for assessing students’ CT. Practical implications and future directions to enhance K-8 teachers’ PCK on CT are discussed in this study.},

  abstract={This study reports a pre-college initiative that aims to integrate computational thinking (CT) in an integrated STEM learning environment in community centers' after-school programs for upper-level elementary school students. The initiative takes a collaborative approach that engages a range of stakeholders including higher institution's STEM educational researchers and disciplinary experts, a school district, three community centers and their satellite campus that serve Title I schools, and both in-service and pre-service teachers to develop and implement an integrated “STEM + CT” curriculum. The design and development of the integrated STEM+CT curriculum was guided by project-based learning (PBL) that engages students in sustained project-based activities and requires students to apply multiple STEM content knowledge and skills to solve a problem, in after-school programs where they enjoy large blocks of dedicated time to learn and practice CT and STEM. The implementation of the curriculum was led by in-service teachers in community centers' after-school programs who serve as facilitators and learners, and bring a depth of pedagogical knowledge, and who also benefit from such sustained interactions. This collaborative initiative brings relevant stakeholders together and helps build a researcher-practitioner partnership that aims to design, study, improve, and scale innovations in teaching and learning, which facilities the solving of a shared challenge of educational practice - how to integrate CT in K-12 STEM learning? - in this study. Lessons learned from the collaborative process are also discussed.},

  abstract={In the 21st Century, technology has become a part of almost everyone's lives in the world and will keep on evolving. Therefore, people's way of thinking must be able to follow the technology evolution. Since 2006, Computational Thinking (CT) has been stated as a fundamental skill for everyone, not just for computer scientists. The concept of CT is very important to be taught to children so that it can be applied as early as possible. In the digital era that is happening now, the suitable CT learning for children is in the form of digital game as an application on smartphones. The interaction and interface of this application is designed using user-centered design approach in ISO 9241210:2010. In order to make this application useful for children, it should be effective to use, easy to learn, and enjoyable. Those three things are the usability and user experience goals of this application. Usability testing is conducted to validate the achievement of the goals by using several metrics, such as completion rate, Single Ease Question (SEQ), System Usability Scale (SUS), and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory for interest/enjoyment subscale. The completion rate is 97,4 %/100% for usability goal effective to use, the SEQ score is 6,12/7 and the SUS score is 70,5/100 for usability goal learnability, and the IMI interest/enjoyment subscale score is 6,02/7 for user experience goal enjoyable. This application has achieved the usability and user experience goals because all the scores from the measurements using those four metrics are above the average.},

  abstract={We present our ideas how to apply modern data science technology and methodology to effectively prepare and statistically analyze large educational datasets which in our case map inquiry skills and computational thinking developed by students in primary and secondary schools at the Slovak national scale, within the project “IT Academy - Education for the 21st Century”. Combining the top two open-source data science tools, Python (within Jupyter notebooks) and R (within R studio software), we illustrate some of results from data preprocessing (cleaning, wrangling) for the diagnostic primary-school test of inquiry skills where Python tools (e.g. Pandas library) became more advantageous. As for the subsequent intensive statistical analysis, R environment was more suitable. We demonstrate summary results of the statistical analysis of the computer thinking diagnostic test for primary and secondary schools, finally cross-checked in SPSS software. Due to the current COVID-19 situation, we are still collecting data from ITA project impacts for which we finally show how we plan to implement further methods for data collecting, analysis and implementation in collaboration with our colleagues - education researchers.},
