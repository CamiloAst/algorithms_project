  title={Bridging K–12 Mathematics and Computational Thinking in the Scratch Community: Implications Drawn From a Creative Learning Context}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={25},
  number={2},
  pages={64-70},
  abstract={This study analyzes 15,453 math topic-based Scratch projects of the online Scratch community to find the relations among K–12 math topics, usage of 13 programming elements, and project popularity. Among the six math topics, only statistics and calculus significantly contribute to projecting popularity. In addition, noncore programming elements, including sound and look, are widely adapted across various math topics and contribute significantly to project popularity. Although some studies discussed the integration of computation thinking (CT) and math in the classrooms, scant research focuses on the effect of math topics on CT element adoption for achieving better integration in the creative learning context. Moreover, few studies involve a large sample size for generalizable findings.},

  abstract={This paper investigates how to increase understanding of design and sustainable systems by scaffolding cognitive access and transfer of learning using eclectic approaches to experiment with networks of design potentials. Cognitive access simulates multi-criteria case indexing, refined from knowledge induction derived from analyses of random but related cases based on search strategies. Randomization of the search space encourages emergence of heuristic solutions, fuzzy though informed transfers and further refinement of schema. We investigate the type of navigational structures/design resulting from creative reuse/refactoring and lean management; and whether there will be evidences of knowledge induction from randomized search scaffolded by Case-based Reasoning (CBR), which leads to heuristic transfer and learning. Examples from two courses carried out August-December 2017 within the participatory design-agile framework for engagement in Smart Cities are assessed for creative reuse regarding: a) people, process and tools; b) domain engineering; c) component mining and d) open source vs. systematic reuse. Findings confirm longitudinal insights: CBR-informed but emergent search leading to more efficient and higher quality heuristic transfer and learning is scaffolded by systemic modelling and design dependent on four factors.},

  abstract={Programming has become a crucial skill in today’s world. Technology and computers are basically part of anything now. President Obama once referred to the importance of children learning programming: “I do not want our young people to just be consumers, I want them to be producers of this technology and to understand it, to feel like they are controlling it, as opposed to it controlling them.” It is thus an increasing need for an individual to know how to write their own programs. With the increasing dependency on computation, one can anticipate such skills being a requirement for most jobs in the coming years. There is a lot of effort done in this area, however most of them focused on either software or hardware track. The aim of this work is to test if using a hybrid approach for teaching K-12 students programming by combining both software and hardware techniques is more effective than using a singleton approach.},

  abstract={Computational models and simulations can be powerful tools to help learners understand a wide variety of natural phenomena. However, understanding and learning from computational models requires learners to comprehend the rules agents follow that lead to emergent outcomes. Blocks-based programming is useful in scaffolding learners in the early stage of programming tasks. We posit that students can authentically interact with agent-based modeling via a blocks-based dialect of the popular ABM language NetLogo, dubbed NetTango, across many difficulty levels. Specifically, we discuss three different activities in which we have integrated blocks-based programming into STEM classrooms that show blocks can be used for activities of increasing computational engagement and difficulty.},

The existence of software vulnerability makes the software system vulnerable to attack and affects the reliability of the software system. In this paper, the upper computer system uses the HashMap structure to store the query data directly in the structure and reduce the mapping process from data to table objects. After that, the rationality of the system module is analyzed by building a complex network model, and the robustness of the system is improved by finding the key nodes.},

A higher educational institution requires the introduction of new approaches to teaching that ensure the development of professional, creative, information, and communicative competencies of graduates. The article presents the discipline “Numerical Methods” and “Theory of Computational Experiments”, which are basic for students in the field of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. The knowledge, skills and abilities obtained while studying the discipline will make it possible to carry out applied projects in the field of mathematics, natural sciences, operations research, and machine learning. These disciplines can also be recommended to students in the areas of training Applied Informatics and Mathematical Support of Information Systems due to the importance of mastering this material and subsequent use in solving applied problems.},

  abstract={While preparing students for careers beyond graduation, HBCU faculty often have to balance the priorities of bridging the gap between the level of student preparation and the expected level of preparedness as influenced by industry and discipline standards. Prioritization of these standards does not always align with the experience of students at Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSI). The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) 2013 Computer Science Curricula guidelines highlight version control as one of many core tools in the Social Issues and Professional Practice (SP) Knowledge Area students should experience in their upper-level software engineering courses. Research has demonstrated that at this level, students receive exposure to the tool but are not able to gain sufficient mastery. Other researchers have advocated for version control being introduced earlier in the computer science curricula. There is limited research that indicates that this particular tool improves the learning outcomes for students or significantly complements the other ACM Knowledge Areas. This paper explores the challenges experienced by an HBCU faculty member while integrating GitHub into an advanced programming class. It is important to note, there is no research that directly addresses the use of version control in predominately African American classrooms.},

  pages={82848-82866},
  abstract={Computational thinking has become a required capability in the student learning process, and digital games as a teaching approach have presented promising educational results in the development of this competence. However, properly evaluating the effectiveness and, consequently, student progress in a course using games is still a challenge. One of the most widely implemented ways of evaluation is with an automated analysis of the code developed in the classes during the construction of digital games. Nevertheless, this topic has not yet been explored in aspects such as incremental learning, the model and teaching environment and the influences of acquiring skills and competencies of computational thinking. Motivated by this knowledge gap, this paper introduces a framework proposal to analyze the evolution of computational thinking skills in digital games classes. The framework is based on a data mining technique that aims to facilitate the discovery process of the patterns and behaviors that lead to the acquisition of computational thinking skills, by analyzing clusters with an unsupervised neural network of self-organizing maps (SOM) for this purpose. The framework is composed of a collection of processes and practices structured in data collection, data preprocessing, data analysis, and data visualization. A case study, using Scratch, was executed to validate this approach. The results point to the viability of the framework, highlighting the use of the visual exploratory data analysis, through the SOM maps, as an efficient tool to observe the acquisition of computational thinking skills by the student in an incremental course.},

  abstract={This document presents the results of the development of a learning program on computational thinking through programming challenges with robots oriented to early childhood. The methodological approach used was quantitative, using a quasi-experimental design, taking pretest/posttest measures, with experimental and control groups. The sample of participating students was 46. They belonged to a group of first grade of primary education, aged between 6 and 7 years, in a Spanish educational center. The learning of computational thinking was measured through the following dimensions: algorithmic thinking-sequences, abstraction-patterns and debugging. The learning activities used were an adaptation of the activities proposed in the “TangibleK” robotics curriculum. The results generated show positive effects in relation to the level of achievement reached by the students in the proposed challenges; in other words, there is a significant effect on the mastery of skills related to computational thinking. Differences were found between the pretest and posttest measures of the experimental group. Those of the latter group were statistically significant and higher than those of the control group. Therefore, we can statistically attribute the mastery of computational thinking skills to the participation in the training activities.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is irrefutably a must-have skill in today's digital world. This is why it is a requisite course in most college curricula. Computational thinking is a broad term encompassing fundamental concepts of computing such as formulating problems and expressing their solutions in computational steps that can be processed by a computer. The ability to organize and analyze data is also a part of computational thinking. Following this paradigm, educational institutions have adopted various methods to teach computational thinking including programming. This paper will explore a specific project within the computational thinking course taught as an introductory course in all major programs at the Higher Colleges of Technology in the United Arab Emirates. The intention of the paper is to demonstrate how a project-based data analytics assessment in such a course can be used to foster in students, a greater awareness of a contemporary and critical global issue such as waste management. To examine the effectiveness of this project, the paper documents and evaluates the work of a group of students who carried out data analysis on secondary data collected from a notable website on “waste management”. The methodology implemented for this task is developed based on a prescribed course syllabus and assessment structure which promotes student-centered and inter-disciplinary learning.},

  abstract={Pattern recognition is one of the fundamental competencies associated with computational thinking and STEM education. Although much has been written to define computational thinking (CT), we argue that CT is a multi-faceted construct and specific aspects of CT (such as pattern recognition) should be examined. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review of literature on pattern recognition to define pattern recognition as an aspect of computational thinking. The synthesis included the Engineering Village database (Compendex and INSPEC). We searched peer reviewed articles and the keywords, pattern recognition, pattern generalization and education. The initial search resulted in 208 articles. The screening of abstracts more closely resulted in 17 relevant articles, which were then read in detail by two researchers. The review of this pool resulted in two relevant articles, one with a focus on mathematics education and the other one in the context of medical education. Surprisingly there were no articles that examined pattern recognition as part of engineering or computer education. Further research examining specific aspects of CT is necessary.},

Four components were designed for the course: course objectives, course content, course activities, and course evaluation. A controlled experiment was performed to validate the course's influence on developing learners' computational thinking, and a questionnaire was employed to examine the experimental class learners' experience with the course. The results found that the level of computational thinking in the experimental class was also significantly different from the pretest, and the students in the experimental class rated each item of the course above 7 points. This indicates that this course has a significant effect on cultivating students' computational thinking, and the learners had a good learning experience and made gains from this course.},

  pages={3698-3713},
  abstract={We present an empirical evaluation of immersion and self-avatars as compared to desktop viewing in Virtual Reality (VR) for learning computer programming and computational thinking in middle school education using an educational VR simulation. Students were asked to programmatically choreograph dance performances for virtual characters within an educational desktop application we built earlier called Virtual Environment Interactions (VEnvI). As part of a middle school science class, 90 students from the 6th and 7th grades participated in our study. All students first visually programmed dance choreography for a virtual character they created in VEnvI on a laptop. Then, they viewed and interacted with the resulting dance performance in a between-subjects design in one of the three conditions. We compared and contrasted the benefits of embodied immersive virtual reality (EVR) viewing utilizing a head-mounted display with a body-scaled and gender-matched self-avatar, immersive virtual reality only (IVR) viewing, and desktop VR (NVR) viewing with VEnvI on pedagogical outcomes, programming performance, presence, and attitudes towards STEM and computational thinking. Results from a cognition questionnaire showed that, in the learning dimensions of Knowledge and Understanding (Bloom's taxonomy) as well as Multistructural (SOLO taxonomy), participants in EVR and IVR scored significantly higher than NVR. Also, participants in EVR scored significantly higher than IVR. We also discovered similar results in objective programming performance and presence scores in VEnvI. Furthermore, students’ attitudes towards computer science, programming confidence, and impressions significantly improved to be the highest in EVR and then IVR as compared to NVR condition. Our work suggests that educators and developers of educational VR simulations, who want to enhance knowledge and understanding as well as simultaneous acquisition of multiple abstract concepts, can do so by employing immersion and self-avatars in VR learning experiences.},

Laws of computation give meaning to the formalisms in which programs are expressed, and can be used to predict or explain program behavior, or to uncover bugs. This paper presents Calypso, a language inspired by Microsoft's Kodu Game Lab but designed for programming actual mobile robots rather than characters in a virtual world. The initial implementation of Calypso uses the Cozmo robot by Anki. Like Kodu, the Calypso interpreter can be described by five key laws. An understanding of the laws and how to apply them constitutes a mental model of computation. Calypso provides a variety of affordances and scaffolding techniques to foster development of effective mental models and facilitate computational thinking.},

  abstract={Contribution: We present a framework for teachers to investigate the relationships between attributes of students’ solutions in the process of problem solving or computational thinking. We provide visualization and evaluation techniques to find hidden patterns in the students’ solutions which allow teachers to predict the specific behavior of students or to prevent some student mistakes or misconceptions in advance or further pedagogical intervention. Background: Formal concept analysis is a method of unsupervised Machine Learning that applies mathematical lattice theory to organize data based on objects and their shared attributes. Several fuzzy extensions of formal concept analysis have a great potential to visualize and evaluate students’ solutions, to categorize the solutions into overlapping biclusters (formal concepts) or to generate the attribute implications between extracted attributes. Research Question: Does formal concept analysis describe the various solutions and the relationships between the extracted attributes of students’ solutions in the educational and computational thinking game Light-Bot? Methodology: Targeting the evaluation of 64 students’ solutions in the Light-Bot game, we construct the formal contexts of the extracted attributes. We apply formal concept analysis to construct the concept lattices from two binary formal contexts and to generate attribute implications and their fuzzy counterparts to find the dependencies between the extracted attributes. Findings: The results of our paper provide a description of various students’ solutions which are visualized in the concept lattices. 1) Regarding the concept lattice of binary formal contexts, we obtained the characterization of the largest biclusters which includes a description of the largest group of similar solutions. 2) The attribute implications mainly reveal the characterization of similar solutions, e.g., with a higher count of executed commands in solutions. 3) Using fuzzy attribute implications, we obtained the characterization of solutions with unnecessary commands, going out of the game area, or using indirect recursion.},

  abstract={A considerable body of research examines people's perceptions of the nature of science. There is also extensive research about what those perceptions are for teachers, and what strategies can be used to change them. There is, however, very little information about what these perceptions may be in the case of computer science. In fact, computer scientists struggle to agree on a definition of their discipline, and perhaps the only term common term to all existing definitions is that of computational thinking. This paper reports on an investigation into perceptions about computer science occurred during a series of professional development workshops for Australian Digital Technologies teachers. These workshops aimed to promote the computer science discipline by providing skills and resources necessary to teach computer science and computational thinking. The results of our investigation indicate that Digital Technologies teachers in our sample (N=16) had one common misconception about the nature of computer science. We also found that the misconception was changed after 3 days of intensive education about computational thinking, computer science and its applications.},
