  abstract={Extensive studies have already documented the importance of introducing computer science into K-12 which lies in equipping students with computational thinking. And professional development accelerates the speed of integrating computational thinking curriculum into K-12 education. This study aims to explore primary school teachers' perception and perspective of attending professional development activities for teaching coding. The context in which this research was undertaken is in mainland China, Hong Kong, Brunei Darussalam. 107 participants (n = 107) in total involved in this research. The result of this study shows that 1) some primary school teachers still have the misunderstanding on the concept of computational thinking. 2) lack of pedagogical content knowledge and content knowledge are major challenges teachers have in teaching coding. 3) non-cognitive factors, such as anxiety, confidence, always influence teachers' teaching which cannot be neglected. 4) School culture plays an essential role in involving.},

  abstract={Block-based programming languages reduce the need to learn low-level programming syntax while enabling novice learners to focus on computational thinking skills. Game-based learning environments have been shown to create effective and engaging learning experiences for students in a broad range of educational domains. The fusion of block-based programming with game-based learning offers significant potential to motivate learners to develop computational thinking skills. A key challenge educational game developers face in creating rich, interactive learning experiences that integrate computational thinking activities is the lack of an embeddable block-based programming toolkit. Current block-based programming languages, such as Blockly and Scratch, cannot be easily embedded into industry-standard 3D game engines. This paper presents IntelliBlox, a Blockly-inspired toolkit for the Unity cross-platform game engine that enables learners to create block-based programs within immersive game-based learning environments. Our experience using IntelliBlox suggests that it is an effective toolkit for integrating block-based programming challenges into game-based learning environments.},

Scratch is a visual programming language used by youth to design programs like animation, game, or music. Their computational thinking skills take place around program decompositions, program patterns, and data representation in the shared Scratch programs (called projects). Through the exploratory work, we found that some cues, such as deep nested iteration, may be successfully used as indicators of users computational thinking skills. This suggests future directions for assessing youths computational thinking skills development and educational opportunities emerging from shared Scratch projects.},

The study captured reactions and responses from ten undergraduates who had no background in Programming and were facing difficulties coping with an introductory course in Programming. Four Lego Mindstorms units were deployed to examine the participants' problem-solving and computational thinking skills. Findings indicate a high positive response (t=3.88 and p =0.004 for Problem Solving; t=-4.13 and p=0.003 for Computational thinking) to the use of Mindstorms as a strategy to encourage higher-order thinking, a critical skill in learning Programming.

  abstract={The popularization of digital educational devices with low barriers to entry has encouraged the development of many training activities oriented towards the incorporation of technology in schools. In some cases, the introduction of technology has led to the development of new educational practices that support the development of computational thinking. However, the supposed benefits of these approaches have not been properly assessed. Moreover, having taught over 30 workshops with the Scratch programming tool to teachers at different educational levels (primary, secondary, university), we found no evidence of subsequent methodological changes in schools. This study tries to understand the dissonance between the alleged success of initiatives around digital literacy and the lack of continuity in the use of user-friendly programming environments like Scratch. For this purpose, we analyzed the evolution of the grades of Scratch programming achieved by the students of the School of Education of Vitoria-Gasteiz and their engagement with Scratch. We also interviewed teachers from different schools who have participated in Scratch workshops with us. After this study, we identified some of the circumstances that facilitate and hinder the development of computational thinking. Since we consider Scratch as a resource that allows the development of new methodological approaches in the classroom as well as the acquisition of skills related to computational thinking, we propose a framework that will help to overcome the current status.},

  abstract={Fundamentals of Computer is a compulsory course of non-majors in many universities of China. In this paper, we explore the reform on this course for two goals. One is to redesign the teaching content: from operation oriented to computational thinking oriented. Computational thinking is one of the most important ability for 21st century and has become the primary goal of computer foundation education. New content covers the basic principles of computer science as well as the fundamental ways of thinking and problem solving with computer. The second goal is to improve teaching methods by leveraging mobile technology. We propose the use of MIT App Inventor, which is a simple tool for creating mobile applications for Android. Students with no prior knowledge of programming can create entertaining and socially useful applications with App Inventor while practicing computational thinking.},

  pages={365-370},
  abstract={With the introduction of distance learning during the lockdown, teachers faced a number of problems on how to implement the teaching. Educational robotics was particularly negatively affected by this period. In our country, educational robotics is usually taught in informatics classes. However, in many schools, the teaching of informatics during the lockdown was very limited and often focused only on basic digital skills. As a similar situation occurred in several European countries, the idea of supporting teachers in such cases was proposed. Within an international project we are involved in, a methodology is being designed to develop computational thinking in students at all school levels through educational robotics in combination with a school arts subject. The methodology is based on the idea of project-based learning and should use blended learning methods. In this paper, we describe the planning and the course of an educational activity – a project – using the currently developed methodology. The results presented are from its pilot validation with lower-secondary students without previous experience with robotics. The project combined the theme of Greek myths with robotics using LEGO SPIKE Prime. During the validation, we focused primarily on students’ work with basic programming concepts. Our research problem was to validate the quality and potential of the proposed methodology and the computational thinking skills it can develop. The paper concludes with recommendations for further development of the methodology and also for the use of the selected robotic kit with respect to programming in informatics classes.},

  abstract={Although there have been many advances in end-user programming environments, recent empirical studies report that programming still remains difficult for end-users. We hypothesize that one reason may be lack of effective support for helping end-user programmers problem-solve their own way around barriers they encounter. Therefore, in this paper, we describe the Idea Garden, a concept designed to help end-user programmers generate new ideas and problem-solve when they run into barriers. The Idea Garden has its roots in Minimalist Learning Theory and problem-solving theories. Our proof-of-concept prototype of the Idea Garden concept in the CoScripter end-user programming environment currently targets three barriers reported in end-user programming literature. It does so using an integrated, just-in-time combination of scaffolding for problem-solving strategies, for design patterns and for programming concepts. Our empirical results showed that this approach helped end-user programmers overcome all three types of barriers that our prototype targeted.},

What are colloquially known as programming games present these challenges as puzzles where computational thinking and coding skills have a fundamental role in successfully overcoming them, even though they are not serious games and have been designed purely as entertainment products. Indeed, algorithm design and coding is the fun part. This paper presents a survey of all such games up to February 2020 published in the Steam digital distribution platform, categorizing them by content covered according to a basic programming curriculum. This study provides some insights on the nature of this kind of games and allows assessing their adequacy as educational tools, broadening the body of knowledge on available games for teaching computational thinking and coding, beyond serious games.},

  abstract={In this study, we propose an AR (Augmented Reality)-based virtual educational robotics learning system, called "AR Bot", which aims to support the learning activities of computational thinking and STEM (science technology engineering and mathematics) education. The system consists of two major elements: AR Bot card and AR Bot app. The AR Bot card is a AR trigger for displaying learning materials and quizzes. Smartphones with AR Bot app can be used to scan the AR Bot cards, and then enter the learning units that uses visual blocky programming editor to practice various robot tasks. The motions of virtual robot can be demonstrated in the authentic scenes with AR technology via mobile devices. The AR Bot system is designed to facilitate computational thinking and STEM education in K-12 schools. In the current state of this study, the core programming editor engine of AR Bot has been developed, and the researcher team will prepare to conduct the experiments into STEM courses in a primary school in Taiwan. The AR Bot system is expected to help strengthen the interaction between teachers and students in the classroom, leverage the learning effectiveness, and reduce the cost of robot equipment for schools.},

This paper starts with the “College Computer Curriculum”, which is the first computer course for undergraduate students. By using virtual reality technology, this paper gives the college teacher an experimental design method of “College Computer Curriculum”. Some exploratory research works have been performed to explain how to embody the basic problems of computer public course. Finally, we introduce a set of virtual experiment libraries, which are independent research and development.

  abstract={Computational thinking is considered critical for learning to code in K-12 education standards. The logic-first, syntax-later argument has been instrumental in promoting block-based languages such as Snap! and Scratch with limited success. In contrast, we believe that expressing the logic of computational problems in the student’s language is more convenient and natural. In such an environment, learners will experience the least impedance mismatch between their conceptual view and the target code they write. In this paper, a new natural language-based programming system, called TryPL (Try Programming in Logic), is introduced and discussed. We demonstrate that TryPL helps to identify gaps in logic and assists in validating learners’ mental models of abstract algorithms. An argument is also made as to why using a natural language-based programming environment and a learning model to teach computational thinking could be more effective and appealing to K-12 and first-year college students.},

In this study, the “AgilePoint NX” program course was established, and computational thinking was introduced into the course to guide students, through the image flow and low-code learning process, to carry out structured thinking and question speculation, and complete task exercises. This aims to teach design students to learn programming and computational thinking through a cloud-based low-code development platform with image processes and interdisciplinary learning processes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and evaluate the learning effect through classroom learning observation, simple questionnaire survey, imagination scale, and other methods. Finally, the study found that in interdisciplinary programming learning, different factors lead to low learning effects of programming courses for design background students, resulting in different degrees of learning pain points and learning experiences. The power of imagination test is a tentative exploration of this research, but for the low-code development platform with fewer measurement data and biased towards procedural thinking, only predictive exploration has no significant data to show the specific impact on the programming learning process, only As a reference for interdisciplinary study.},

  abstract={This innovative practice WIP paper describes an effort to introduce future teachers, who are primarily Hispanic and planning to be PK-8 teachers, to computational thinking for teacher preparation at a Hispanic Serving Institution located on the U.S.-Mexico border. An interdisciplinary team of education and computer science faculty is implementing efforts to increase pre-college student engagement in computational thinking (CT) along with increased equity, particularly for Hispanic and women. One aspect of these efforts is the modification of an existing CT course that will eventually be required for all teacher preparation students. The first pilot of this CT course was conducted in the fall 2023 and included quality pedagogical approaches to teach CT content to primarily Hispanic pre-service elementary teachers.},

  abstract={This study presents the development of integrated computational thinking in mathematics lessons. The lessons were intended to support students' computational thinking while learning mathematics. To do so, we used the educational design research (EDR) methodology to develop the lessons. We collaborated with mathematics teachers and practitioners to improve the lessons. We also piloted the lessons for a few junior high school students in Indonesia. We collected data from online discussions with teachers and practitioners, GeoGebra files, and screen video recordings. We found that collaboration with teachers and practitioners helped us to refine the lessons. The pilot study showed the engagement of students in programming and debugging. Mostly students could solve the final task to create an inscribed polygon in a circle.},

  abstract={Engineering and technology courses often contain complex concepts, making traditional learning methods challenging. Tools like PLC simulators improve understanding in industrial automation. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the development of technological tools for remote learning. Active PBL (Problem-Based Learning) teaching methodologies, along with logical and computational thinking, enhance comprehension. This article presents a methodology for improving PLC programming through active PBL teaching, logical thinking, and computational thinking in a controlled environment. Developing logical relationships in everyday situations or similar to real ones is key for understanding.},
