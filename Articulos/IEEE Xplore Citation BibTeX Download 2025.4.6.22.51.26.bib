  abstract={Computational thinking is a key universal competence, often taught using methods specific to computer science. One step towards achieving it is learning to analyse and create algorithms. Researchers have long been trying to establish how the form of representation of algorithms (pseudocode versus flowchart) affects its understanding and have reached varying, sometimes conflicting results. This article presents findings that provide objective new data on this topic. In our experiment, we used two different types of algorithmic tasks with three levels of complexity and a group of 114 research participants with varying programming skills. In addition, we used an eye tracking technique that allowed us to collect detailed information about the subjects’ attention distribution during analysis of algorithms. Our results show that subjects took significantly less time to analyse flowcharts (than they did with pseudocode), made much fewer errors, and had higher confidence in the correctness of their solution. Based on eye tracking data, a reduced number of both re-analyses of the algorithm and input data re-referencing was observed for graphically presented tasks. The difference in favour of flowcharts was revealed (with few exceptions) for all levels of algorithm complexity (simple, medium, complex), while regarding the duration of analysis the advantage of flowcharts increased with the growing complexity of algorithms. For complex algorithms, a significant relationship was observed between algorithm presentation and level of programming skills versus the duration of task solving and confidence level. Our study strongly supports the idea of using graphic representation of algorithms both when learning to code and in acquiring computational thinking skills.},

  abstract={Educational game design environments are used for teaching computational thinking and software engineering concepts to novices. In software engineering education, there has recently been calls for "innovative methods for software teaching and training in online courses" (http://2014.icse-conferences.org/seet). However, to date, learning these concepts is tied to a formal learning environment and the presence of a teacher. In line with the new educational opportunities provided by the Web such as massive open online courses (MOOCs) and e-learning 2.0 platforms, we have created an online educational game design environment with integrated learning resources including video tutorials, showcases, and communication tools. To understand the effect of online educational game design environments with integrated support for learning on novices' use of the system and their learning, we conducted a mixed-method study with nine participants. While the learning goals were achieved to a high degree, the analysis of participants' interaction with the system reveals interesting phenomena about user preferences, such as the fact that during the given computational thinking tasks, the participants preferred the synchronous communication channel to other forms of commonly provided learning resources such as forums.},

  abstract={This Research Full Paper presents the effects of our weeklong Professional Development class on the programming skills of nineteen high school teachers, their confidence in programming, and their confidence for teaching programming. A primary objective of the CS10K and CS For All initiatives is the education of K-12 teachers in aspects of computer science and computational thinking so they can teach CS courses in their schools. Many of these educators have degrees in disciplines other than computer science, such as math, science, and business, so preparing them to teach CS is a challenge, particularly since most K-12 teachers have limited time to devote to learning new curriculum. This study describes how we managed a short course in computational thinking and programming to a group of high school teachers. We illustrate through survey data assessment and evaluation that significant gains in skill level and self-efficacy can be realized within a short but intensive week of face-to-face training. Five months later we follow-up with the same cohort to see if earlier achievements remain evident over time. Discussion throughout the paper identifies strengths and weaknesses of the training week, which is useful to others planning to undertake similar PD offerings.},

  title={Adapting an OER Textbook for the Inverted Classroom Model — How To Flip the Classroom with BBC micro:bit Example Tasks}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Full Paper Research-to-Practice The current COVID-19 crisis has created significant challenges for schools. The growing importance of “flipping the classroom” and the needful emphasizing of online-learning were owed to the situation. To meet these requirements, materials and tasks must be adapted. The Open Educational Resource (OER) textbook “Computational Thinking with the BBC micro:bit” was developed for the introduction of Computational Thinking (CT) for 10-14-year-old pupils in Austria's secondary schools. Example tasks in the textbook are designed with an open end and present extensions with ideas for further development instead of ending abruptly. This article provides a guideline for a clear distinction in redesigning existing lessons following the Inverted Classroom Model (ICM) using videos for pre-class work and live task extensions for in-class work. Which parts in the learning design must remain as live lessons and which parts can be adapted for video lessons? The respective research shows that examples that have a makerspace activity as an extension are especially helpful for an efficient determination of the appropriate part in the learning design and particularly suitable for an adaptation with ICM. The central advantage of the ICM is that it responds flexibly to the individual learning needs of each student. It allows students to take their time reviewing the material at their own pace without getting left behind. The textbook used here encourages pupils to find their own solutions by explorative learning using the block-based programming environment MakeCode. Additional information to be uncovered by the learner is provided for every single step in the accompanying online wiki website. Results from observations showed that this uncover-function, being a central element of the online material, encouraged the learners to explore their own way in finding a solution with playful elements and increased motivation. The many haptic elements of a makerspace activity are in particular useful for consolidation of the learned and are predisposed for in-class work and deepening the understanding following the constructionism theory. A Design-Based Research (DBR) approach is used to create and evaluate the redesign of a proven example task in a pilot project. Teachers, who are already familiar with the BBC micro:bit and the OER textbook, were trained on how to use the “flip-version” of an example task in their lessons and asked to develop a lesson plan for implementation. The didactic approach to redesigning the material and teacher training was evaluated during the first cycle of DBR. Results from expert interviews showed that the redesigned material and training deliver a solid ground for rework and further research on a larger scale.},

  title={Teaching reform of programming basic course based on SPOC blended teaching method}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={},

  pages={411-415},
  abstract={As an important course in computer education in higher education, the programming basic course has problems in teaching and learning. The role of teachers is knowledge imparters. And the teaching methods despise students' development. Students often have fears and difficulties in their study, which is not conducive to build their computer application ability and computational thinking. In view of the teaching status quo and existing problems of the programming basic course, this paper proposes to use SPOC blended teaching mode to clarify the role of teachers and students, to develop an interactive teaching mode, to adopt case teaching, to enrich SPOC resources. And we provide students with timely feedback, and change the evaluation methods and other aspects. Through these reforms, we found that students' ability to read and write programs have been improved. The quality of teaching, and the cultivation of computational thinking are improved.},

  abstract={In recent years, the interest in introducing programming activities into the classroom has increased, emphasizing the importance of promoting computational thinking in young learners. Robotics-based learning environments are intended to facilitate the learning of programming at the primary level and support developing skills such as collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving thinking in a cross-curricular approach. An Austrian research project focuses on developing and implementing a robotics-based learning environment using the educational design research approach to gain insights into the introduction of computational thinking in primary education. This paper reports on a study to identify preliminary design principles of the learning environment that form the basis of the prototyping cycle of the overall research. Data were collected by interviewing seven experts who have theoretical and practical expertise on educational robotics in primary education. The resulting six preliminary design principles describe the first insight into the design of robotics-based learning environments.},

  pages={275-281},
  abstract={While block-based programming has successfully eliminated critical syntactic barriers to programming, it remains unclear how effectively it aids in overcoming semantic, logical, and pragmatic programming challenges that hinder computational thinking. These challenges are likely to far outweigh the syntactic ones. With the goal of creating a highly accessible programming tool for young students using mobile devices, we explored the concept of pragmatic prebugging to begin addressing these challenges. By pragmatic prebugging, we refer to proactive debugging tools designed to prevent logical errors. This article introduces RULER.game as a Computational Thinking Tool with built-in pragmatic prebugging, enabling novice programmers to create games through a paradigm we call proxy-based programming. A small study exploring error rates found statistically significant performance improvements of proxy-based programming compared to block-based programming.},

  abstract={In this study the pair computational problem-solving between the student and ChatGPT was analyzed. The three university students who were experienced in using Python program in computational problem-solving participated in the study. In data collection, a problem involving “limit and sequence” from calculus was used to examine students' collaboration with ChatGPT. Students were asked to construct a program that produces a solution to this problem in Python, and meanwhile, it was stated that they could work in pairs with ChatGPT. The responses provided by ChatGPT to the students in the computational problem-solving were evaluated in both computational and mathematical contexts and a list of cases in which ChatGPT could and could not support students in the computational thinking practices was created. Aside from the incorrect or implicit answers provided by ChatGPT, in general, it was determined that ChatGPT supported the student's performance in computational thinking. It was deduced that it was important for the student to make a rational problem-solving plan and to guide the ChatGPT with the appropriate prompts in order to use rational questioning that leads to productive argumentation with ChatGPT.},

  abstract={Advances in computer technology have expanded our capacity to solve problems on a scale never imagined, using strategies previously unavailable to us. Today’s "digital natives" have grown up in a world where technology is rapidly evolving, creating new fields of study, new types of jobs, and requiring new skill sets. Algorithmic and computational thinking are foundations for solving different problems from all domains and are not always closely related to computers and programming. They are currently primarily used in teaching computer science and STEM subjects but can be applied to all subjects and in all life situations. The paper presents the need to develop computational thinking in various subjects of primary education, with particular emphasis on combining digital ("plugged") and non-digital ("unplugged") activities, as well as on the development of algorithmic thinking. Four methodological scenarios with activities for the development of algorithmic thinking in primary education are presented.},

  abstract={Problem solving plays a central role in computer science classes, whereby the problems to be analyzed are often already available in encoded form. The initial process where the learners have to parse information into symbols using adequate representations, has hardly been considered systematically so far. However, encoding development is essential for the understanding of sign processes and for general education. This paper therefore presents the development and evaluation of a teaching unit called “Cup Song Encoding” designed to model information encoding using a percussion song as an example. It simultaneously imparts coding theory concepts and fosters Computational Thinking of students. The material of the teaching unit is available online. The teaching unit was successfully tested with over 200 students in different age groups in K-12 during which the students' solutions were recorded and examined. The outcomes of the unit demonstrate the potential for encoding modeling to be a valuable addition to K-12 computer science education. The results also show how Computational Thinking methods can be integrated in computer science classes.},

  year={2020},
  volume={13},
  number={2},
  pages={312-325},
  abstract={A distinctive feature of game-based learning environments is their capacity for enabling stealth assessment. Stealth assessment analyzes a stream of fine-grained student interaction data from a game-based learning environment to dynamically draw inferences about students' competencies through evidence-centered design. In evidence-centered design, evidence models have been traditionally designed using statistical rules authored by domain experts that are encoded using Bayesian networks. This article presents DeepStealth, a deep learning-based stealth assessment framework, that yields significant reductions in the feature engineering labor that has previously been required to create stealth assessments. DeepStealth utilizes end-to-end trainable deep neural network-based evidence models. Using this framework, evidence models are devised using a set of predictive features captured from raw, low-level interaction data to infer evidence for competencies. We investigate two deep learning-based evidence models, long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and n-gram encoded feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). We compare these models' predictive performance for inferring students' knowledge to linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) and naïve Bayes models. We perform feature set-level analyses of game trace logs and external pre-learning measures, and we examine the models' early prediction capacity. The framework is evaluated using data collected from 182 middle school students interacting with a game-based learning environment for middle grade computational thinking. Results indicate that LSTM-based stealth assessors outperform competitive baseline approaches with respect to predictive accuracy and early prediction capacity. We find that LSTMs, FFNNs, and CRFs all benefit from combined feature sets derived from both game trace logs and external pre-learning measures.},

  abstract={Computational thinking and creative thinking are valuable tools both within and outside of computer science (CS). The goal of the project discussed here is to increase students' achievement in CS courses through a series of computational creativity exercises (CCEs). In this paper, the framework of CCEs is described, and the results of two separate studies on their impact on student achievement are presented. Students in introductory CS courses completed CCEs as part of those courses. Students in Study 1 came from a variety of programs, and students in Study 2 were engineering majors. A profiling approach was used to test whether the impact of the CCEs could be accounted for by differences in students' motivated and self-regulated engagement. Overall, CCEs had positive impacts on students' grades and knowledge test scores, and although there were differences in achievement across the profiles, the impact of the CCEs was generally consistent across profiles. The CCEs appear to be a promising way to increase student achievement in introductory CS courses. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.},

  abstract={Humanoid robots, with a focus on personalised social behaviours, are increasingly being deployed in educational settings to support learning. However, crafting pedagogical HRI designs and robot interventions that have a real, positive impact on participants' learning, as well as effectively measuring such impact, is still an open challenge. As a first effort in tackling the issue, in this paper we propose a novel robot-mediated, collaborative problem solving activity for school children, called JUSThink, aiming at improving their computational thinking skills. JUSThink will serve as a baseline and reference for investigating how the robot's behaviour can influence the engagement of the children with the activity, as well as their collaboration and mutual understanding while working on it. To this end, this first iteration aims at investigating (i) participants' engagement with the activity (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory-IMI), their mutual understanding (IMIlike) and perception of the robot (Godspeed Questionnaire); (ii) participants' performance during the activity, using several performance and learning metrics. We carried out an extensive user-study in two international schools in Switzerland, in which around 100 children participated in pairs in one-hour long interactions with the activity. Surprisingly, we observe that while a teams' performance significantly affects how team members evaluate their competence, mutual understanding and task engagement, it does not affect their perception of the robot and its helpfulness, a fact which highlights the need for baseline studies and multi-dimensional evaluation metrics when assessing the impact of robots in educational activities.},

  abstract={Adaptive online learning can facilitate students' support by responding immediately to the user's interactions. Good feedback to students helps closing the gap between actual and desired performance. In this paper we analyze how to introduce online adaptive formative learning in Computer Science, a discipline with well documented challenges that are hard to tackle with traditional classroom methods. Specifically, we developed illustrative learning items teaching Model-Driven Design and implemented them in an online system that implements a model for automatic formative assessment developed by University of Torino. The model takes advantage of an automatic assessment system initially designed for STEM disciplines, then adopted for teaching languages and other disciplines too. The key features of the adaptive model supported by the online system are algorithmic questions, availability, contextualization, immediate feedback, interactive feedback, and open answers. These features are portable across subject domains, so the system can be adapted to include new subjects. We chose MDD because it is a topic of Computer Science education connected with Computational Thinking, software design, and formal methods, which are three of the core areas in need of enhanced support.},

  abstract={It is one of a teacher's challenges in lesson planning to consider all levels of learning involving students' team skills while taking the actual subject content into account. This descriptive study examines how the student-centered approach can be utilized as supportive classroom climate and how it can be combined with cooperative team tasks for solving computational thinking problems using an easy accessible computer-coding environment. Drawing on existing concepts and research methods this study applies a case study approach with mixed methods to investigate students' development of team-attitudes and characteristics of team cooperation. It turned out, that students identified the quality of cooperation in their teams as beneficial and productive while from an outside point of view their teamwork seemed to be unorganized and not cooperative. These contradicting results were clarified in a classroom meeting, where it became clear, that the student-centered classroom climate still could have influenced students' team attitudes in a way that students felt comfortable to express themselves in their, sometimes not so nice, youth language during problem solving tasks but while be able to solve problems effectively.},

  abstract={We describe computational treatments of archival collections through a case study involving World War II Japanese-American Incarceration Camps. We focus on automating the detection of personally identifiable information or PII. The paper also discusses the emergence of computational archival science (CAS) and the development of a computational framework for library and archival education. Computational Thinking practices are applied to Archival Science practices. These include: (1) data creation, manipulation, analysis, and visualization (2) designing and constructing computational models, and (3) computer programming, developing modular computational solutions, and troubleshooting and debugging. We conclude with PII algorithm accuracy, transparency, and performance considerations and future developments.},

  abstract={The rise of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 and the increasing reliance on the digital economy drive the need for a new set of skills, especially in robotics learning, that includes computational thinking (CT) and adversarial thinking (AT) for the young generation. The need for CT-related skills includes various fields, such as robotics, engineering, computer science, mathematics, music, arts, and humanities. Therefore, adopting robotic learning with CT and AT can enhance learning skills over the conventional learning model. This paper presents a systematic literature review on CT and AT practices in robotics learning to improve educational methods. This study conducts a systematic literature review from four databases: ACM, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect. Sixty-five studies in robotics learning to increase CT and AT skills were analyzed by applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study’s findings show that CT and AT are significant in training students to engage in robotics learning activities. These considerations will lead to strengthening their skill and critical thinking. The study also suggests that integrating these skills can prepare teachers for critical thinking and boost student learning. The findings suggest that CT and AT can directly adopt digital adversarial learning skills to improve overall robotics learning activities. For future studies, the difference in learning ages related to robotics activities with CT and AT applications can be studied to deeply comprehend the effectiveness of CT and AT applications.},

  abstract={Full paper, Research-to-Practice. With the nation's continuing shortage of scientists and engineers, there is an urgent need for diverse students, especially Hispanic students, to enter and complete science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education at all levels. Contributing factors to the low representation in STEM areas are the lack of Hispanic youth's exposure to engaging and relevant experiences with science in their early stages of development and the lack of Latino scientists as role models that are visible, tangible, real, and inspiring to their communities. In addition, student experiences in math and science in the middle grades have emerged as a “filter” that prevents many students from pursuing advanced STEM courses in high school and, therefore, limits their knowledge of and interest in exploring STEM subjects and careers later in their education. This paper presents a research-based approach to attract middle school students to STEM fields in a majority Hispanic region, using a game-based learning platform. The platform integrates computational thinking in the area of water conservation at middle-school level by using simulations and data visualization in concurrent learning modules. The concepts introduced in the platform are universal enough to be successfully employed in other geographical regions with different student demographics.},

  abstract={At present, there is still a lack of suitable artificial intelligence curriculum in primary and secondary schools in China. Based on a project-based learning model, an artificial intelligence course was designed for middle school-aged students. Learning objectives were deconstructed according to the five concepts of artificial intelligence, and learning contents were arranged according to the cognitive characteristics of middle school students. In the process of teaching, the cultivation of students' computational thinking ability was paid great attention, and teaching example was given at the end of the paper.},

  abstract={In knowledge-based societies new generations are flooded more and more intensely with narratives of inherited and newly generated knowledge, which is simply accessible for these generations, or to be acquired by them. Informatics and computer sciences are continuously developing new information-storage devices and a multitude of software more rapidly than ever. However, effective information search and processing require an information literacy which the new generations characteristically, and more and more demonstrably, do not have. National and international empirical research proves that the algorithmic thinking of the younger generations, which is indispensable for the world of informatics, is underdeveloped when it comes to the effective and productive use of digital tools. Moreover, the phenomenon of hyper attention invades the everyday life and the learning habits of the younger generation to a greater and greater degree. The essence of the HY-DE model is to aid the students' learning process with the help of the teacher's purposeful control of the phases of attention (hyper, mixed and deep attention). One aim of the present study is to introduce a new application of the HY-DE model, entitled Data-Structure Validator HY-DE model (DaSVa HY-DE). In the introductory phase, the DaSVa model focuses on how the HY-DE attention-divisions manifest themselves in webpage-search as well as in the information retrieval that it yields, and what the roles of the hyper, mixed, and deep attention modes are in the development of computational thinking and algorithmic skills. In the full hyper attention status the search for specified contents is carried out, focusing on webpages which consist of data organized in table or table-like structures. The automated and semi-automated conversion of the webpages however requires the decreasing of hyper attention leading to deep or mixed attention. The final result of this conversion process is/are well-structured table(s) suitable for automated data retrieval in spreadsheets, database management, and programming. The application of the original HY-DE model would lead us to its modification. In the advanced phase of the DaSVa HY-DE model the students can also experience how the webpages are designed and structured, how they support information and data retrieval, how successful the algorithmic based retrieval can be, and how the approach would lead students to the application of the theory of well-structured webpage design. With this model, from the hyper attention data collection status, through a deep and/or mixed attention algorithm building and data analyzing process, students would reach a higher-level hyper attention, the developer status.},

  abstract={This paper describes a new technological evolution of the Sucre project, which aims to foster a vocation for science and develop computational thinking and programming skills in pre-university students. This improved version is called Sucre4Stem and has been designed from the Internet of Things perspective. At a technological level, we differentiate two main tools, SucreCore andSucreCode. SucreCore provides a new, more compact design, encapsulates an advanced microcontroller and supports wireless connectivity with the ability to create online variables and functions. SucreCode, the block-based visual programming tool, has a revamped interface and allows wireless communication with SucreCore. At the pedagogical level, Sucre4Stem makes it easier to implement new group dynamics and to create novel types of collaborative projects between groups of students. In this article, we also explore how these collaborative projects can be carried out by taking advantage of the different types of communications between SucreCore and the server-side platform using shared online variables and functions.},
