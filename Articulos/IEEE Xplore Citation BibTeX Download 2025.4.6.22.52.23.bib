  abstract={The emergence of cloud computing technology has motivated a very high number of users in different organizations to access its services in running and delivering their various operations and services. However, this surge of cloud users has led to the problem of uneven load sharing among the cloud computing infrastructures. As a result, federated cloud infrastructure was initiated to provide more cloud computing resources to accommodate more cloud users’ requests and also to provide equal requests mapping with the available cloud resources. Nevertheless, the issue of unequal allocation of requests within the datacenter(s) that makes up the federated cloud environment still persists. This research work presents an intra-datacenter load balancing algorithm in a federated cloud environment named; the intra-balancer adapted throttled algorithm to evenly distribute requests in each datacenter that formulate the federated cloud infrastructures. The simulation of the intra-balancer was carried out in CloudAnalyst, the results of the implementation showed that the intra-balancer outperformed the Round-Robin and ESCE with 98.93ms and 2.26ms for the response and processing time respectively. The results assert that the intra-balancer algorithm provides a better load balancing solution in a federated cloud environment.},

  abstract={Although there are many systems designed to engage people in programming, few explicitly teach the subject, expecting learners to acquire the necessary skills on their own as they create programs from scratch. We present a principled approach to teach programming using a debugging game called Gidget, which was created using a unique set of seven design principles. A total of 44 teens played it via a lab study and two summer camps. Principle by principle, the results revealed strengths, problems, and open questions for the seven principles. Taken together, the results were very encouraging: learners were able to program with conditionals, loops, and other programming concepts after using the game for just 5 hours.},

  pages={150-156},
  abstract={The use of computer programming in K-12 spread into schools worldwide in the 70s and 80s of the last century, but it disappeared from the educational landscape in the early 90s. With the development of visual programming languages such as Scratch, this movement has emerged again in recent years, as teachers at all educational levels and from different disciplines consider that the use of programming enhances learning in many subjects and allows students to develop important skills. The systematic literature review presented in this article aims to summarize the results of recent research using programming with Scratch in subjects not related to computing and communications, as well as studies analyzing the kind of skills students develop while learning to code in this environment. Although the analyzed papers provide promising results regarding the use of programming as an educational resource, this review highlights the need to conduct more empirical research in classrooms, using larger samples of students that allow to obtain clear conclusions about the types of learning that could be enhanced through programming.},

  year={2020},
  volume={8},
  number={},
  pages={186233-186256},
  abstract={Schools, universities, and other educational entities are increasingly aware of the untapped potential of digital transformation, an essential process for increasing efficiency and collaboration, and reducing costs and errors in the management of at-scale training systems. In this context, the “Riconnessioni” project was promoted by the Compagnia di San Paolo in agreement with the Ministry of Education but planned, started and developed by the Foundation for the School. The digital transformation started with a defined strategy that leveraged opportunities presented by new technology while meeting the objectives of system stakeholders. Through several steps, that strategy was developed for education connecting everything to support tomorrow’s digital world and creating strong strategic partnerships able to build an ecosystem connecting people, processes, and things into a powerful, secure, and smart communications network. This paper reports on the three-year Riconnessioni project, which is combining the energies of teachers, managers, administrative staff, students, among others, and experimenting with new learning models, taking advantage of opportunities that emerged from perceptions stemming from concerns and systemic issues. To date, more than 150 schools in Italy have been included in the project, together with 550 teachers selected to scale up the instructional process. Using a methodology called “cascade training”, the 550 selected teachers were able to spread the knowledge to more than 2,600 colleagues. The monitoring and evaluation activity performed in Riconnessioni aims at processing information on implementation and results, following three lines. First, it regularly evaluates project activities from a reporting standpoint. Second, it verifies the plan consistency against implementation achievements. Third, it identifies changes produced and focuses on teachers’ and students’ skills to evaluate the effects of the project. The assessment framework is also discussed in this work, reporting on results regarding feedback, follow-up, and effects gathered from the field. The evaluation highlighted that labs were indeed able to improve teachers’ competence and underlined the added value of cascade training which spread digital domain knowledge and awareness into the group of involved schools.},

  pages={251-259},
  abstract={Despite the enthusiasm and initiatives for making programming accessible to students outside Computer Science (CS), unfortunately, there are still many unanswered questions about how we should be teaching programming to engineers, scientists, artists or other non-CS majors. We present an in-depth case study of first-year management engineering students enrolled in a required introductory programming course at a large North American university. Based on an inductive analysis of one-on-one interviews, surveys, and weekly observations, we provide insights into students' motivations, career goals, perceptions of programming, and reactions to the Java and Processing languages. One of our key findings is that between the traditional classification of non-programmers vs. programmers, there exists a category of conversational programmers who do not necessarily want to be professional programmers or even end-user programmers, but want to learn programming so that they can speak in the “programmer's language” and improve their perceived job marketability in the software industry.},

  pages={5-10},
  abstract={Teaching students how to code in K-12 classrooms is considered as one of the major keys to promoting engineering education in the future, which can potentially enhance the competency and computational skills of students to adhere better learning outcomes in higher education. The success of promoting coding education or integrating it into school curriculum depends on the perceptions of teachers and headmasters in schools, and how well they believe on coding education and prepare for the innovative teaching and learning. In this exploratory research study, it reports the results of a large-scale quantitative questionnaire surveying 42 primary and secondary schools (n = 42) in Hong Kong, where computer programming has not been regulated as a compulsory course in K-12 curriculum. The questionnaire aims to investigate the school belief on coding education and their practical challenges while integrating it into their regular school curriculum. Our results show that there is a trend in the local schools promoting coding education with positive perceptions on teaching and learning. However, teaching challenges are also mentioned in the survey waiting for solutions, such as lack of teachers training and unified curriculum. Therefore, the empirical experiences of these schools have set forth the future research direction in design and implementation of coding education in K-12 classrooms not only in Hong Kong but also in the globe.},

  abstract={This Research to Innovative Practice Full Paper presents a multidisciplinary, design-based research study that aims to develop and study pedagogical models and tools for integrating machine-learning (ML) topics into education. Although children grow up with ML systems, few theoretical or empirical studies have focused on investigating ML and data-driven design in K-12 education to date. This paper presents the theoretical grounds for a design-oriented pedagogy and the results from exploring and implementing those theoretical ideas in practice through a case study conducted in Finland. We describe the overall process in which middle-schoolers (N = 34) co-designed and made ML applications for solving meaningful, everyday problems. The qualitative content analysis of the pre-and post-tests, student interviews, and the students' own ML design ideas indicated that co-designing real-life applications lowered the barriers for participating in some of the core practices of computer science. It also supported children in exploring abstract ML concepts and workflows in a highly personalized and embodied way. The article concludes with a discussion on pedagogical insights for supporting middle-schoolers in becoming innovators and software designers in the age of ML.},

  abstract={The abstract nature of programming makes learning to code a daunting undertaking for many novice learners. In this work, we advocate the use of comics—a medium capable of presenting abstract ideas in a concrete, familiar way—for introducing programming concepts. Particularly, we propose a design process and related tools to help students and teachers create coding strips, a form of comic strips that are associated with a piece of code. We conducted two design workshops with students and high school computer science teachers to evaluate our design process and tools. We find that our design process and tools are effective at supporting the design of coding strips and that both students and teachers are excited about using coding strip as a tool for learning and teaching programming concepts.},

  abstract={Learning how to code by creating video games promises high motivation, engagement and fun for the students. In this study, the Unity Game Development Environment, a widely spread tool for professional game developers, was employed for teaching secondary school students to develop their own video games. The research design for the game development activities followed a Design-Based Research approach. The learning design was based on situated learning accompanied by a mix of tutorials, teacher explanations and support & collaboration amongst the students. The results of the first iteration of Design-Based Research confirmed the hypotheses that video game development was fascinating and engaging for the majority of young learners. Using a professional tool with an embedded physics engine provided additional attraction for teenagers. From the first cycle of game development we learned that dealing with the complexity of the development environment in a systematic way, time management, advanced teachers' competencies in handling the environment, and providing well balanced learning materials are crucial to successfully employ a professional tool like Unity in secondary education. Besides improved materials and a stepwise process of adding complexity e.g. by starting with developing mini-games, the most important change for the second cycle is to significantly extend the time allocated for game development. This seems justified due to the vast spectrum of skills and competences students tend to acquire when collaborating on complex and exciting issues like developing games.},

One group used physical robots in their lessons to complete programming assignments, while the other group used robot simulators. We are interested in finding out if there is any difference in the learning gain and experiences between those that use physical robots as compared to robot simulators. Our results suggest that there is no significant difference in terms of students' learning between the two approaches. However, the control group that uses the physical robot shows a more positive response in their attitudes towards computing. We discuss the implications of our findings in relation to engaging students and challenges in using physical robots from the learner perspectives and ways to alleviate this. Finally, by considering the insights from students' comments, we also suggest an alternative that may give both benefits of using both physical robots and robot simulators.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose that the data generated by educational robots can be better used by applying learning analytics methods and techniques which can lead to a deeper understanding of the learners' apprehension and behavior as well as refined guidelines for roboticists and improved interventions by the teachers. As a step towards this, we put forward analyzing behavior and task performance at team and/or individual levels by coupling robot data with the data from conventional methods of assessment through quizzes. Classifying learners/teams in the behavioral feature space with respect to the task performance gives insight into the behavior patterns relevant for high performance, which could be backed by feature ranking. As a use case, we present an open-ended learning activity using tangible haptic-enabled Cellulo robots in a classroom-level setting. The pilot study, spanning over approximately an hour, is conducted with 25 children in teams of two that are aged between 11-12. A linear separation is observed between the high and low performing teams where two of the behavioral features, namely number of distinct attempts and the visits to the destination, are found to be important. Although the pilot study in its current form has limitations, e.g. its low sample size, it contributes to highlighting the potential of the use of learning analytics in educational robotics.},

A concept for an immersive educational virtual environment for learning the theoretical computer science concept of finite state machines is presented. A first draft for the virtual reality aims to immerse students in a world of islands (states) with treasure islands (final states). Each symbol from the input alphabet is illustrated through another boat on every island. Students navigate through the islands by looking at one of the boats on the current island using a head-mounted-display. They then take the shipping route of the selected boat (the state-transition function) by pressing a button on a controller. The goal of the game can either be to reach Treasure Island and open the treasure chest or to complete the map.},

  abstract={Cyber security requirements are influenced by the priorities and decisions of a range of stakeholders. Board members and Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) determine strategic priorities. Managers have responsibility for resource allocation and project management. Legal professionals concern themselves with regulatory compliance. Little is understood about how the security decision-making approaches of these different stakeholders contrast, and if particular groups of stakeholders have a better appreciation of security requirements during decision-making. Are risk analysts better decision makers than CISOs? Do security experts exhibit more effective strategies than board members? This paper explores the effect that different experience and diversity of expertise has on the quality of a team's cyber security decision-making and whether teams with members from more varied backgrounds perform better than those with more focused, homogeneous skill sets. Using data from 208 sessions and 948 players of a tabletop game run in the wild by a major national organization over 16 months, we explore how choices are affected by player background (e.g., cyber security experts versus risk analysts, board-level decision makers versus technical experts) and different team make-ups (homogeneous teams of security experts versus various mixes). We find that no group of experts makes significantly better game decisions than anyone else, and that their biases lead them to not fully comprehend what they are defending or how the defenses work.},

  abstract={This Research-to-Practice Full Paper presents a reflective analysis of robotic literacy activities focused on children and teenagers. Robotic literacy is integrated or being integrated into the education system for children at an early age all around the world. Most of the teachers in charge of this education lack skills and are left to fend for themselves. This study proposes to focus on the discourses made by teachers and learners during such activities, and especially the metaphors used spontaneously. It takes shape through two robotic literacy activities. The first activity involved the robots BeeBot, BlueBot and Ozobot in seven classes of children from 3 to 10 years old. The second activity consisted of a five half-days training for 13 participants from 8 to 15 years old. They designed, built and programmed a robot. Young people's representations and interactions with robots involved in educational activities are observed to contribute to the development of questions for critical technology education. Analyses are carried out using the conceptual metaphor theory of Lakoff and Jonhson. Three roles are identified: the metaphor that helps to understand, the metaphor that makes tangible, and the metaphor that serves as a catchphrase. A metaphor can take more than one role and, whatever its role, can be classified as a living or non-living metaphor. Using living metaphors may hide aspects of the machine and raises ethical issues, inter alia. It is then essential to deconstruct young people's representations of the machine. This can be achieved by analyzing robots as social constructions that reflect human intentions.},

  abstract={Computer Science (CS) seems to be everywhere - in our smartphones, apps, cars, watches and so much more. It is integrated into almost every discipline and has a growing importance in our daily lives, yet even with top salaries, exciting companies, and promising careers, the job market remains underpopulated and under-representative of women. Though its applications are everywhere, CS is an often misunderstood field due to lack of exposure and knowledge. This paper explores the misperception associated with Computer Science and examines the efforts to make it more inclusive by attracting women, introducing CS earlier at the K-12 level, and improving entry-level college courses.},

  abstract={Visual block programming environments can be defined as those programming environments that rely on objects rather than words to code the program. These types of environments are characterized by facilitating the task of the people who carry out the programs. This is mainly since they are more visually friendly. In addition, with this type of environment the person who makes the programs will not get the famous syntactic errors that characterize the programming tasks with textual programming languages. Along this paper, a set of tools commonly used in educational robotics are showed. Furthermore, a deep analysis in two of these tools are detailed. Additionally, some educational scenarios are detailed, as long as their relationship to students’ competencies and how to drive the scenarios in order to accomplish with the competencies. Finally, a study of the results from experience is included.},

  abstract={Contribution: A technical course in a multidisciplinary university program has to provide high-level skills, with limited lecturing hours and student background. This article investigates the principles for its design and reports about a study case. Background: The overall course organization needs to address specific learning targets and teaching techniques, different from those used in traditional courses on the topic. Research Question: A stepwise strategy assists a principled design that allows dynamic, long-term improvements. Methodology: The evaluation of its applicability requires a years-long record of historical data. The article studies the evolution of a course over six years using simple monitoring techniques: surveys and rubric-based examinations. Findings: Monitoring emerges as an essential feature for course evolution: a focused examination provides the best results, while institutional, wide-spectrum surveys appear to be of little help.},

  abstract={Recursion is a powerful conceptual tool, nevertheless it is often considered too abstract and technical to be effectively proposed in lower secondary school. Here we present our experience in introducing 8th graders to recursive strategies where the active observation of recursive algorithms execution allowed pupils to understand the main features of a recursive process, to convince themselves that it works, and to unveil the mystery of its effectiveness. In fact, by focusing on the self-similarity of the input data and the possibility to delegate blindly the solution of subproblems, pupils were able to recognize the heuristic potential of recursion. We started with an unplugged activity using LEGO bricks where a recursive algorithm was executed by pupils, and we continued with an activity supported by a software tool we developed ad-hoc. The undertaking was concluded by the abstract consolidation of the basic concepts and properties which had come out during the previous activities.},

  abstract={Starting from our teaching experience and previous research on programming for non-technical university students in Japan and Denmark, we identify an unarticulated dependency of programming materials from other technical domains, which causes a knowledge domain mismatch in learners. We approach this mismatch on two fronts: by defining a novel way to structure beginners courses that moves away from the classic bottom-up approach based on math-related problems, and instead leverages on multimedia as a motivational and powerful general-purpose domain to ground programming and scaffold its understanding; and via the design and implementation of new Python library that simplifies multimedia programming. We are currently organizing tests of both multimedia library and the new course structure in Japan and Denmark.},
