  abstract={Reparative description of collections is a growing element of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts at cultural heritage institutions. However, the scale and complexity of the work can be overwhelming in practice. I demonstrate that computational methodologies and data analytics can be used to kickstart the planning stage for reparative description of archival finding aids. I discuss auditing and analyzing finding aids at the University of Chicago Library’s Hanna Holborn Gray Special Collections Research Center for potentially problematic language utilizing Python, Trifacta, Tableau, and Neo4j. I describe insights gained by treating finding aids as data, and I share recommendations for structuring reparative description work in a logical and attainable way.},

  number={},
  pages={1-9},
  abstract={While governments, teacher educators, and teachers recognize the importance of introducing computer science (CS) in K-12, there is limited understanding about when the teacher preparation should start and how it needs to be done. Furthermore, with the rapid expansion of digital technology in our society and the way it affects our lives, new educational frameworks for better teacher preparation have been developed, such as TPACK and CTIntegration, that situate new technologies and their role in education to meet the new societal demands. There is a larger body of research in Mathematics on how on how to prepare teachers to teach than in CS. This study explores how graduate teaching candidates and undergraduate pre-service teachers engage with Math+CS modules differently. We were interested in the similarities and differences in the way senior-level pre-service teachers in a mathematics and technology class and graduate-level teacher candidates in a methods class interact with Math+CS integrated modules. Working with the concepts of variable, input, and output, we investigated which knowledge domains were leveraged among groups in different classes, what connections they make between the concepts in math and CS, and their uncertainty. The results indicated that there was a difference in the way the teaching candidates in their methods class approached the computational modules than the pre-service teachers. The pre-service teachers focused more on developing their CS content knowledge, and the teacher candidates were interested in making connections between their knowledge domains, reflecting on how their students would think about the concepts in math, expressing more concerns, and asking more questions to develop their TPACK.},

  abstract={This study designs a jigsaw collaborative learning method in a metaverse virtual space (JCLM-MVS) to promote learning performance and CT in Scratch programming. This study used a quasi-experimental research method with 48 fifth-grade students from two classes in Taiwan's elementary school as the research participants. One class of 24 students was randomly assigned to the experimental group using JCLM-MVS to conduct Scratch programming learning, whereas the other class of 24 students was assigned to the control group using the traditional teacher-centered teaching method. The study found that the experimental group of learners showed significantly better learning performance than the control group. Although the results showed no statistically significant difference in overall and most dimensions of CT between the two groups, both learning approaches were found to promote CT effectively.},

  abstract={This paper exhibits a systematic literature mapping of the considerations required to develop algorithmic thinking in a first course in computer programming (CS1) in university academic programs in computing. In the methodological process of this study, 5 stages were proposed: research questions, search, selection, quality assessment and synthesis extraction. In this way, 5 guiding questions were drawn, 136 articles generated by the search stage were analyzed and the synthesis of 55 documents that met the criteria of this research was concluded, thus compiling the different practices used for the development of algorithmic thinking. In addition, as a result of the systematic literature mapping, a definition of Algorithmic Thinking oriented Software Engineering and didactics is proposed.},

It utilizes virtualization to encourage group collaboration and grants anytime, anywhere access to the smart home facility. It incorporates dynamic binding capability that allows students to either use the sensors and actuators hardware they check out and install locally for development, or to conduct experiments in the smart home facility. Once the development is completed, the programs can be deployed remotely, and students can make observations through web cams strategically situated in the smart home facility and the logs of the system's operations and users' activities. The REACH platform is designed to support a large spectrum of computer science courses, from the equivalence of computer science lab 101, interdisciplinary projects, all the way to research projects in artificial intelligence, pervasive computing, and human computer interactions.},

  abstract={Use of archival collections is accelerated by the presence of finding aids, which communicate the arrangement and description of collection contents. To arrive at the optimal arrangement of a collection, archivists rely on some item-level processing or knowledge gained by exploring and manipulating digital reproductions of the contents. In this paper we consider archival student and instructor perspectives from hands-on course experiences directly with two distinct collections: one pertaining to the development, 2017 transfer and launch, and ongoing maintenance of the International Research Portal for Records Related to Nazi-Era Cultural Property (IRP2), and one a selection of unclassified catalog entries about digitized nuclear science reports. Visualizing is a data practice that permits the discovery of key content patterns, identification of computational models to be carried out to aid further analysis, and query-resolution for subject experts with precise - and historically significant - research questions. While archival data visualizations have previously been implemented as an extension of descriptive work including finding aid element counts, here we connect visualization to the work of archival outreach and access. We study how visualizations generated by groups of students working with textual and numerical dataset portions can ultimately accelerate time-sensitive uses of collections.},

  abstract={The work presented in this Full Paper is categorized as Innovative Practice, as per FIE guidelines. Robofest is a worldwide robotics competition program for students in 4th-12th grade and college. Student teams design, construct, and program their autonomous robots in a variety of competition categories. In the 2019–2020 academic year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we designed an innovative and novel online robotics competition format using Zoom Webinar tools rather than cancelling the world championship competition. The purpose of this paper is to show how we designed, implemented synchronized online robotics competitions, and to analyze the results and efficacy of the Robofest Online World championships (ROWC). One hundred and fifty-three teams comprising of 360 students competed in three age divisions and six categories held weekends from Aug. 28 through Oct. 10, 2020. Most teams set up playing fields at home and we trained judges online prior to the competitions. We sent the description of an unknown game ending task and unknown playing field factors to local volunteer judges at the same time just before the 30-minute work time on the competition day. After checking to make sure that all the teams were ready to play, we sent the game start signal to all the teams at the same time through Zoom. The local judges scored the runs and submitted videos to the Robofest office for score verification. Robofest office staff also proctored the competitions through Zoom screens for fair competition results and maximum learning opportunities. It was an innovative practice of using online conference tools to organize the world's first unique “synchronized” online autonomous robotics competitions for engineering and computing education. Anonymous coach & judge survey results after the ROWC showed that the satisfaction rate was better than the in-person competition surveys of previous years. Additionally, 95 % of students surveyed after the ROWC exposure said that they would now consider a career involving STEM versus 91 % of students surveyed after the 2019 in-person competitions.},

  abstract={Critical thinking and problem solving are fundamental skills to function successfully particularly in today's world. When programming, these skills are promoted, developed and deployed. In this context, Universidad ORT Uruguay and The University of Edinburgh co-created in 2015 a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) that teaches young teenagers how to program. The course was implemented simultaneously in 2 versions: in Spanish, called “¡A Programar!” and in English, called “Code Yourself!”, which are available on the Coursera platform. Since its launch in March 2015, more than 139,000 people from 197 countries have registered. Initially it was offered in a “fixed session”; while currently it is offered in an “auto-cohort” mode. In both cases, students' surveys indicate that the course has met or exceeded expectations (values above 93%). In this paper, we detail the characteristics of the MOOC, and we analyze and compare the modes and results.},

  abstract={We are investigating how non-programmers make sense and solve simple computational problems. We developed a game where a robot has to assemble a sandwich, collecting a specific list of ingredients. Our game follows principles and offers game mechanics typical of games for learning programming. The main innovation of our game is that it visualizes the generality property of algorithms through double levels, that we call twin-worlds, in which one same algorithm is executed by two robots in assembling their sandwiches. Results from early testing with university students enrolled in the education of Media Studies show that the game is usable, levels can be solved at various degrees of complexity (e.g. with and without using loops), and that the students were able to make sense of our twin-worlds levels and formulate general algorithms for both worlds. However, the gathered feedback also highlights the need to explore alternative implementations of the twin-worlds concept.},

Thereupon, the computational logistics is suggested systematically from the perspectives of definition evolution, conceptual architecture, problem-oriented exploration, and practical philosophy. All provide an elementary sketch and synopsis of CLS oriented scheduling and decision methodology. Subsequently, a typical application of computational logistics is discussed on a container terminal handling system (CTHS). After the abstraction and automation of container terminal-oriented logistics generalized computation, the memory access model and computing principles in computer science are transferred and integrated to propose the yard facility-block accessing and switching model (YFB-ASM). The processor affinity, spatial locality and cooperative computing of CTHS are discussed according to the practice data in a large-scale CTHS. The YFB-ASM is supposed to establish a solid foundation for rolling plan, task scheduling, resource allocation and performance analysis of CTHS. It illustrates the feasibility, availability, credibility and practicability of computational logistics preliminarily.},

  abstract={In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, marked by the proliferation of artificial intelligence and robotics, the role of engineering education stands as a cornerstone of sustainable progress. Recognizing this imperative, engineering curricula are increasingly incorporating a competency-based approach that reflects the complexities of the real world, for lifelong learning, using enabling and disruptive technologies such as humanoid robotics. We present a case study from the Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico City Campus, where NAO robots are used in social projects with immediate impact in the fields of health and education, addressing sustainable development objectives. This research shows projects that have had a significant social impact in different communities in Mexico, in the areas of education and health with innovative solutions that motivate and engage the attention of the audience. A group of students from different engineering careers design, develop and implement application scenarios for the accompaniment and social appropriation of challenges such as: the incorporation of girls in STEM areas, support for groups with intellectual disabilities, dissemination and knowledge of sign language and dissemination of the cultural heritage of Xochimilco as a cultural heritage of humanity. Preliminary results indicate that this pedagogical approach not only inculcates students with essential skills such as problem solving, critical thinking and teamwork, but also makes them more aware of the social implications of their engineering studies. Evidence and results of the involvement of undergraduate students in social scenarios are shown, showing that, by integrating these elements, engineering programs aspire to train professionals capable of harnessing their technical knowledge for the general good of society as well as the perception of the participants and audiences reached.},

  abstract={A dynamic Computational Thinking resolution can be likely in a 6G environment by way of Green-IoT and Artificial Intelligence (AI), important parts of computational thinking. This order requires lowering difficult problems to tinier, more controllable parts and recognizing patterns and friendships at intervals in miscellaneous parts. Machine intelligence approaches concentrate on algorithms capable of learning from data, making judgments and predictions, and executing complex tasks beyond explicit programming. To appreciate the far-reaching quantities of data presented by 6G-connected schemes, computational inference and machine intelligence can be used for the Green-IoT. This has the potential to reinforce the computerization of many processes and bring about a smarter and more efficient use of possessions. Computational thinking that combines Green-IoT, AI, and 6G sciences can transform many areas, including education, and reinforce society's lives through the production of brisker, more adept, and more tailor-made uses and services. The research has been started by outlining key limits utilizing Green-IoT-authorized sensor electronics in the framework of 5G and 6G surroundings, as well as Artificial Intelligence, in this place study's review on computational thinking.

  abstract={This paper describes the outcomes of a three-day teacher professional development workshop aimed at introducing concepts, principles and practices of computational thinking. The guiding research question for this study was: How teachers implement the backwards design process embodying elements of CS Principles (i.e., computational thinking big ideas and computational thinking practices) in the context of their classrooms? The participants of this study included 15 elementary, high school and college level teachers who are also graduate students from a master program in engineering. As part of the workshop participants developed a learning activity that included a set of learning objectives, the design of computational thinking related activities considering appropriate pedagogical strategies, and the integration of mechanisms to evaluate students' performance. Here we describe (a) how participants embodied the CS Principles in the design of learning activities to be integrated into their classrooms, (b) how they used the backwards design process as a tool to implement elements of the CS Principles and (c) what is teachers' performance in integrating CS Principles to the design of learning activities as evidenced by their peer evaluations. Finally, we propose the use of backwards design process together with the CS Principles as a framework for the design of computing learning activities and the development of teacher professional development programs in computing education.},

  abstract={The information society is a reality nowadays, and computational thinking has become a relevant competence for everybody, regardless of age, social status, and primary activity. Information society is everywhere in contemporary life, and algorithmic thinking represents a significant competency for individuals, irrespective of their educational background and social condition. Developing and applying programming competencies represents a high-value know-how ability. Block-based coding and design tools like Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino allow people to successfully build programming competencies in online environments regardless of age and social status. This article presents empirical evidence of the positive impact of the block-based programming language Scratch and the design tool TikerCAD Arduino in practical workshops to develop computational thinking with school children, school teachers, and university students. The results permit finding patterns, and almost transversal teaching approaches to build an elementary computational thinking competency applying Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino, with a block-based approach in both tools and textual programming in the second one. The motivation and wishes of learning in all participants were hegemonic. Those results demonstrate the positive impact of Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino on developing computational thinking competencies without restrictions. This work shows the application of Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino in non-WEIRD contexts and, during the pandemic time, demonstrates the relevance of online education. The results show that developing programming competencies with Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino motivated students’ autonomy and motivation for learning regardless of their education level and status. Those results encourage us to continue using Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino to develop programming competencies without considering age and education level.},

  title={Assessing the Readiness of Pre-Service Mathematics Teachers in Utilizing the Scratch Application: A Case Study at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia},

  abstract={This research-to-practice full paper describes the readiness of pre-service mathematics teachers to incorporate Scratch, a block-based programming application, into mathematics instruction, focusing on their knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Given the rapid technological advancements, leveraging technology in mathematics education is crucial in fostering proficient problem-solving abilities among students. Consequently, computational thinking is recognized as a vital 21st-century competency, a transferable skill for effective problem-solving methods. The study underscores the importance of integrating Scratch, a supportive tool in computational thinking, into mathematics education. However, to integrate this application into mathematics education, pre-service teachers must be prepared to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills and to be ready to accept its use in teaching in the future. The construction of knowledge by pre-service mathematics teachers regarding the Scratch application is examined through the lens of social constructivism, which emphasizes knowledge construction through experience and social interaction. A purposive sample of 60 first- and second-year students participated in an online survey. The sample selection involving two groups aimed to identify significant differences in pre-service teachers' readiness levels across gender, study year, and academic achievement. The findings revealed limited proficiency among pre-service mathematics teachers in utilizing Scratch, particularly regarding its integration into mathematics instruction. Several factors contribute to the deficiency in skills among pre-service mathematics teachers in navigating the Scratch application, including requiring additional time to grasp the programming language employed in the application, challenges in arranging blocks to achieve desired outputs, and struggles in rectifying syntax errors. However, there was a positive attitude towards the application, indicating a strong inclination to enhance their skills. The study also found no significant differences in demographic variables such as gender, study year, or academic achievement, but a slight correlation exists between knowledge, attitudes, and academic achievement. Investigating pre-service teachers' readiness to integrate Scratch into mathematics instruction sheds light into the intersection between mathematics pedagogy and computational thinking. This intersection underscores the importance of integrating programming tools like Scratch into mathematics education to cultivate computational thinking skills. Additionally, the findings contribute to the broader discourse on the role of technology in education and highlight the need for enhanced training and support for pre-service teachers in leveraging technology effectively for instructional purposes.},

  abstract={Computational thinking has become an essential skill nowadays. Many educational institutions around the world have adopted computational thinking as an elementary or complementary subject in their teaching schedules. One of the approaches that is efficient in teaching and learning computational thinking has been visual programming. However, like other applications used daily, visual programming tools can be a limiting factor for the blind in learning computational thinking. This work aims to present the iVProg4all, an accessible visual programming system based on forms. A preliminary study was carried out to test the usability of iVProg4all and accessibility with a blind user. The results show that, although some usability issues need to be fixed, the system proved accessible for blind people.},
