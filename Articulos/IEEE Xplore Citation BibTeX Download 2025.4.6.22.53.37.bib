  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Computer programming has become an increasingly cross-cutting theme and is no longer considered just a specialized subject. In some countries, the inclusion of this subject in the curricula of the basic cycles of their educational systems has been provided for, because it is recognized that programming promotes computational thinking which allows cognitive development of students. In Chile, the Universidad de La Frontera established that an initial programming course is given to all the Engineering degrees. Unfortunately, studies have shown that students are not achieving the competencies defined by the computational thinking approach. This research paper presents a flexible and systematic teaching framework for developing cognitive skills in programming courses. This framework considers the use of a systematic methodology of teaching programming, which focuses on the process of building solutions over the product; using electronic programmable devices; and sets of pre-defined exercises appropriate to various domains of the engineering area.},

  abstract={Nurturing programming talent early is crucial in today's digital world, especially in K-12 education, underscored by the rise of programming competitions for younger students. However, with limited research in programming talent search, discovering programming talent in primary schools posed a significant challenge. Traditionally, various test-based talent search tools have been utilized for programming talent identification, including the Computer Talent Search Test (CTST) and the Beginners Computational Thinking Test (BCTt). Game-based platforms like CodeCombat offer an engaging alternative to overcome this challenge. CodeCombat integrates game-based learning with programming education, allowing students to apply their computational thinking skills in an enjoyable context for learning Python. The study revealed a significant correlation between CodeCombat, CTST, and BCTt outcomes. This highlighted that CodeCombat emerged as a valuable platform for talent search, aligning seamlessly with the objectives of the test-based tools and suggesting its effectiveness in boosting programming learning motivation in primary school.},

  abstract={In Experience and Education, Dewey argued that humankind is “given to formulating its beliefs in terms of Either-Ors, between which it recognizes no intermediate possibilities.” Not surprisingly, educational computing is no exception. One such Either-Or binary that is relevant to our project so far is computing vs. computational thinking.2 A keynote address delivered recently at a computing education conference by the computer scientist and educator Judy Robertson is quite illuminating in this respect.3 Robertson argued against a blind emphasis on computational “thinking” as the centerpiece of computational literacy. Focusing only on creating SCRATCH programs may lead especially young learners away from understanding how the computer actually works as a “machine.” Children's drawings of what is inside a computer show that learning to use computational abstractions that we typically introduce in the K-12 levels—such as variables and loops—does not necessarily help us understand how these abstractions are processed and represented inside the computer. What gets lost in our push to teach children how to code is the physicality of computing as a machine, which involves a deeper understanding of the relationship between the hardware and software—and many other forms of computational abstractions that are not even presented to children as part of their experience of coding or computing.},

  abstract={Programming and robot building are two crucial components in an AI curriculum, while students' learning goal attainment, computational thinking improvement, and autonomous learning improvement are important dimensions to measure students' learning outcomes. In previous teaching practice, virtual simulation platforms are often used as teaching aids, and the operational difficulty of the platforms may reduce students' interest in learning, thus lowering the learning effect. Therefore, based on the 5E teaching model, this study combines gamification elements with virtual simulation integrated learning to explore its effects on the three dimensions of students' learning goal attainment, computational thinking improvement, and autonomous learning improvement.},

  abstract={This research addresses the integration of Machine Learning (ML) into K-12 education, which is increasingly recognized as essential for preparing students for the AI-driven world. However, the current landscape of ML implementation and its impact in K-12 classrooms remain areas of active investigation. In recent years, the integration of ML techniques into K-12 computing education has become increasingly prevalent, reflecting the growing importance of AI-driven and data-driven approaches across computing fields. This study addresses the gaps in understanding how intuition and agency develop in the context of ML systems within K-12 education, while also examining the emerging trajectories, challenges, and opportunities in teaching ML in K-12 education. Motivated by the need to assess the effectiveness and challenges of ML integration in K-12 settings, this survey-based study aims to provide insights into pedagogical approaches, tools utilized, and teachers' perceptions of ML in education. Drawing upon the importance of early ML exposure in developing computational thinking and fostering data literacy, this study seeks to address gaps such as age-appropriate content, teacher preparedness, and ethical considerations. By systematically reviewing existing research and surveying educators, this study aims to offer valuable insights into effective practices, identify tools available, and highlight areas for further research on the responsible implementation of ML in K-12 settings. Furthermore, this study emphasizes the importance of understanding gender-based differences in ML education. It briefly presents gender-based results obtained from surveys and data analysis, suggesting the need for tailored approaches to ML education that address potential gender-based barriers and biases. Additionally, the study discusses the paradigm shift required to successfully integrate ML into K-12 computing curricula, advocating for embracing ML as a fundamental component of future computing education. Ultimately, this study aims to inform computing educators and policymakers about the challenges and opportunities associated with ML education in K-12 settings, laying the groundwork for fostering ML literacy and computational thinking skills among K-12 students.},

  abstract={Using the Scratch environment as a tool to teach programming skills or develop computational thinking is increasingly common in all levels of education, well-documented case studies from primary school to university can be found. However, there are reports that indicate that students learning to program in this environment show certain habits that are contrary to the basic programming recommendations. In our work as instructors with high school students, we have detected these and other bad practices, such as the repetition of code and object naming, on a regular basis. This paper focuses on verifying whether these issues can generally be found in the Scratch community, by analyzing a large number of projects available on the Scratch community website. To test this hypothesis, we downloaded 100 projects and analyzed them with two plug-ins we developed to automatically detect these bad practices. The plug-ins extend the functionality of the Hairball tool, a static code analyzer for Scratch projects. The results obtained show that, in general, projects in the repository also incur in the investigated malpractices. Along with suggestions for future work, some ideas that might assist to address such situations are proposed in the conclusions of the paper.},

  abstract={Robotics and computational thinking are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. A multitude of educational robotics tools have emerged in recent years. Some with a high price and great features, and others with a lower price and lower performance. There are also cost-effective options that allow you to tailor your services to tighter budgets. The presence of robots in our daily lives is becoming more and more common. Therefore, it is interesting that we are oriented to integrate robots in the different levels of our society. This workshop is focused on driving the same content across three different low-cost robotic educational tools. The first one is Scratch, interactive stories, games and animations can be programed. The second tool is Crumble, it is an easy-to-use programmable controller. Its programming interface uses a block programming language which eases its use by children aged below 14. The last but not the least is Arduino, Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It is a platform that incorporates a simple microcontroller and an interface development environment to create the applications to be downloaded into the board. This workshop is aimed to present the mentioned platforms as robotic educational tools for people as the first step to get into robotics world.

  abstract={Since the new Curriculum Reform was carried off, there has been a lot of research on teaching mode of programming in high school. On the basis of the exploration of the potentials if designing a teaching mode with the Scratch Graphical Programming Language, this paper builds a situational teaching mode of programming in high school with Scratch. This teaching mode first design a programming learning situation which is familiar by students because of its close connection to the students' daily life with Scratch for student through the analysis of the common elements between the situation and the concept of programming. The n guide students learning in the situation, and transfer back to the traditional programming environmental after he understand the content of concept. This teaching mode can arouse the students' interests of learning; promote the students' learning transfer ability. Ultimately this teaching mode can help students better understand algorithm programming and established their Computational thinking. Both of them play a significant positive role in developing students' logical thinking ability and their ability in solving practical problem.},

Following on this principle, we developed a 3D virtual collaboration space to provide students with one interface featuring the information and resources required to practice the Sprego method outside of and during classes. We have collected, refined, and structured the available sources and developed detailed tasks with explanations for students in the form of online documents. Our goal was to provide an all-in-one environment for the Sprego method to learn, explore, and practice all its aspects without leaving the 3D space. For our work, we examined different applications that provide virtual 3D spaces with educational support in mind. Our choice was the MaxWhere Seminar system, based on its innovative and effective approach in the field.},

  abstract={Nowadays, there are more cars used on the road. Traffic congestion problems can cause the economy and the environment both directly and indirectly problems, also part of the problem of air pollution. The traffic light management system in the current situation has used a fixed waiting time, which inability to be flexible according to the traffic at different times such as in rush hour and other. It is not efficient enough to manage traffic with fixed waiting time. The organizers came up with the idea of developing an intelligent traffic light system with flexibility according to the number of cars in real-time by reducing waiting time. The paper was designed and developed by implementing the intelligent traffic light system using image processing technology to process the appropriate waiting time from each image frame. Lazarus and OpenGL were used to program based on Pascal language. The software has been developed for receiving traffic video at the intersection to process car image segmentation of each frame and to calculate the distance of the length of the car in each route in addition. It is also possible to calculate the appropriate time for green-light and red-light duration and corresponding to the length of the waiting vehicles in each route at the intersection. This investigated software can be used to reduce the waiting time at the traffic light intersection by 45.35%. In addition, the intelligent traffic light system is also a social development towards a smart city. The project has created the learning environment and computational thinking for society through the process of STEM Education with using IoT and Artificial Intelligence.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Introduction to Computing is a public course for the first-year non-major undergraduate students, aiming at training students for the abilities in computer science and technology with computational thinking. However, as new computer technologies emerge continuously and rapidly, it is required for this course to accommodate more and more knowledge. Therefore the teaching contents are growing enormously, which makes it very difficult to cover all of them in limited hours, and therefore sets an obstacle in understanding computing principles and building up a clear and general picture of computing, especially for non-major students. As computer science and technology are becoming more and more essential for various disciplines and majors, it is urgent for the education community to find out an effective and propagable way to solve this problem. In this regard, we employ virtual reality technology to the experiment teaching of this course, and have developed 18 virtual experiments to support the whole teaching process. For example, Turing machine is a basic model for computer science and technology. However, since it is not a real machine, it is not easy for the students to imagine the working process of Turing machine and understand the related concepts. Another example, the execution of an instruction is very important to understand the principles of computer organization. However, as the information flow is invisible, it is difficult and time-consuming for the teachers to explain how an instruction is executed inside a computer. Therefore, 3D modeling and animation techniques are used to demonstrate the invisible micro-structure of computers, and human-machine interaction and visualization techniques are used to present the internal process of information evolution, thus constructing a complete virtual experiment system of this course, including demonstration experiments, verification experiments and interaction experiments. Our virtual experiments have applied software copyrights and served more than 12,000 students from five universities of China since 2013. The evaluation demonstrates that the virtual experiments have produced excellent results in both teaching effectiveness and learning efficiency, relieved the conflicts between limited hours and vast knowledge, and helped students understand and build up the knowledge of computing.},

  abstract={Crumble is an easy-to-use programmable controller. Its programming interface uses a block programming language that makes it easy for children above 10 to use. In addition, the hardware elements associated with Crumble are very intuitive and easy to connect. For this reason, educational robotics can be easily implemented thanks to the card connectors. The motors and servos can be managed by Crumble. Different sensors such as the ultrasonic distance sensor, infrared distance sensor and line sensor can also be connected. In addition, Crumble can handle up to 32 RGB (Red, Green and Blue) LEDs (Light Emitter Diodes) independently and with 24-bit color resolution. Robotics and computational thinking are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. Today, robotics training tools are raised with the aim of promoting innovation and motivation of students during the learning process. Robots are becoming more and more common in our daily lives; therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our society. This document presents a workshop that focuses on two main objectives. The first is to make an event to promote Crumble locally. On the other hand, the aim of this event is to present a robotic teaching tool so that people can take their first steps in the world of robotics. This workshop is aimed at those children and adults who want to discover the possibilities that Crumble brings in the introduction to robotics. An introduction to Crumble in the context of educational robotics is developed throughout this workshop.},

The workshops were divided into two learning scenarios, unplugged programming and hands-on robot play. Unplugged programming encourages understanding of the core concepts of programming such as algorithms and computational thinking rather than focusing on the programming language. In the second learning scenario, pupils were introduced to two educational robots used as a learning tool - Thymio and Codey Rocky. The aim of the second activity was linking the programming concept to a real-world scenario. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected using pre- and post- questionnaires. The pre-questionnaires contained questions about the pupils' background knowledge, i.e. basic concepts of programming and robotics. The post-questionnaires were designed to evaluate the workshops impact on the pupils' perception of these observed concepts and their overall satisfaction with the workshops. Combining unplugged activities with robots helps bridging the gap between imagination and reality, therefore improving learning.},

  abstract={We present a block-based language for specifying feedback to novice learners about the programs they are constructing in a block-based programming language. In addition to feedback based on run-time and output checking, we are particularly interested in immediate feedback: corrective guidance given as the program is being constructed. Immediate feedback is a natural extension of the block-based language philosophy. Block-based languages prevent by design certain types of mistakes in all cases. Immediate feedback guides against, without fully preventing, problem-specific mistakes (i.e., constructions that are erroneous in only some cases). A feedback specification contains a block pattern and a set of actions that can be taken whenever the corresponding pattern is present or absent in the student's block program for a given problem. The paper illustrates the language through several examples derived from misconceptions found in the block-based programs of students taking a university-level Computational Thinking class. The feasibility of the proposed approach is shown by the translation of a specification using an evolving programmatic interface in BlockPy, a dual block/text programming environment for a subset of Python.},

RPPs represent an approach to research that, by design, is both more equitable and more ethical because it leverages community stakeholder experiences and perspectives to inform research questions, methods, and meaning-making. RPPs are thus potentially powerful tools for equity-oriented initiatives such as CS for All. Beginning in December 2016, the Research + Practice Collaboratory, an NSF-funded initiative based at the University of Washington, has led ten RPP development workshops for CS for All, collectively serving over 700 members of the community. At these workshops we have collected data about how the community sees itself benefiting from the adoption of RPP approaches to the work. In this experience paper we describe what we have learned about the field's interests with respect to adopting RPP approaches to the work.},

  abstract={For all computer scientists the term `modeling' is well known. It displays an often-used method, which is applied in each field of computer science to investigate, describe and plan problems or structures. With the help of models, large and complex structures are divided into smaller parts, which leads to a better understanding of the problem and often provides input for the solution. With the help of different types of models, different perspectives of one problem can be observed and discussed. These processes are not only part of computer science respectively computational thinking. Problem solving skills are needed in any domain and should be trained as well as possible in primary and secondary education. This could be supported by the computer science concept of modeling including processes like reduction, decomposition, abstraction, generalization etc. and appropriate techniques like UML Unified Modeling Language or the Entity-relationship model. We suppose that a consequent use of modeling beginning in different subjects during primary and secondary education can train and improve problem-solving skills. Before being able to verify this hypothesis, it is necessary to find a way to integrate modeling in schools despite of not being part of the curriculum. This is one aim of our project “Informatics - A Child's Play”, which tries to implement different computer science concepts in different subjects of primary and secondary education. To reach this goal we firstly have to convince and train teachers. In this paper some topics of modeling are presented as they were adapted for workshops in primary and early secondary education considering the age and interests of the students as well as topics taken from their surroundings. Furthermore, we present first evaluation results concerning its acceptance and usefulness for teachers and students as well as their performance in understanding and applying modeling in different lessons.},

  abstract={The Industry Revolution 4.0 was first being introduced in Malaysia on September 2018. The reaction from this introduction has initiated the Malaysian Government to promote Industry Revolution 4.0 in industrial manufacturing and construction system. This however, gives impact to the graduating student whom seeking for employment where specific skills were required by the industry. The gap of skills was identified in this study. Questionnaire survey was distributed among graduating students and Alumni. Mean score and Relative Importance Index were used in the analysis. The finding reveals that the most skill required by the industry are Computational Thinking (Rank 1), follow by Social Intelligent (Rank 2) and Design Mindset (Rank 3). The findings of this study can be used as a reference for the universities to review the engineering curriculum and syllabus.},

  abstract={Research has identified multiple reasons why people do end-user programming but has yet to quantify one of the most basic: making more money. This is an important gap in the literature given the current widespread efforts to promote computational thinking skills, because this education campaign is often linked to the argument that end-user programming skills will contribute to workers' long-term career prospects. Therefore, this paper presents a study investigating how the earnings of workers varied as a function of whether they used spreadsheets/databases and/or did programming at work. Examining survey data from 2003 revealed a positive correlation of earnings against these variables, even after controlling for the occupations of workers. Overall, occupation-adjusted earnings were 14% higher for workers who used spreadsheets/databases and who also did programming, versus those who did neither. These results provoke numerous questions for future research regarding what financial benefits workers can expect to obtain in different settings through end-user programming.},

  abstract={The results obtained by the elementary school students in subjects like math and Portuguese mother language have been worrisome during the last few years. There are several reasons for this, but opinions point to the student's inability to solve problems, difficulties in logical reasoning and lack of critical attitude. The Portuguese Ministry of Education proposed in 2015/2016, in extracurricular period, the Getting Started with Programming challenging in primary School activities, with the intention of promoting computational thinking competences in students. Two schools from Coimbra city opted to use Scratch software for the implementation of this project aiming to promote school success in subjects already mentioned. The project, based on the academic curriculum of 4th grade, intends to link the theoretical knowledge with the practical knowledge, promoting the characteristic values of the city of Coimbra. This project implementation resulted in different applications (computer games) created by students, covering the contents of the mentioned subjects, but concretizing these knowledge with the socio-cultural and environmental realities of the city of Coimbra. The following study demonstrates the results obtained in 5 classes in 2015-2016 and six classes in 2016-2017, according to student satisfaction and project evaluation.},
