  abstract={Computational thinking and coding has received considerable attention over the past several years. Considerable efforts worldwide suggest the need for more empirical studies providing evidence-based practices to introduce and engage children with coding activities. The main goal of this study is to examine which programming concepts students use when they want to develop a game, and what is the interrelation among these concepts. To achieve our goal, a field study was designed and data were collected from coding activities. In detail, during a two-week period, one-day workshops were organized almost every day on which 44 children participating in, with ages between 8-17. The workshops follow a constructionist approach and comprise of two parts. First the children interact with robots, and then develop a game using Scratch. The findings provide a deeper understanding on how children code by showing the use of specific programming concepts to develop their projects and their correlations. Hence, we improve our knowledge about children's competences in coding.},

  abstract={Educational robotics is a practice that has been disseminated in Brazil and in the world, allowing the inclusion of technology in the school environment through stimulating pedagogical activities for students, making them practice teamwork, fine motor coordination, and computational thinking, among other benefits. For the educational robotics classes to be executed in the most effective way, the teacher must be trained to use this tool, and from there propose and/or execute classes that use the technology to help in the teaching of curricular subjects in basic education. However, many teachers do not realize what can be possible with robotics in the classroom, and this often causes them not to choose to learn more about this technology. In this work, we developed a web system called Repo-Educ in which a teacher can access information about robotics lessons created by other teachers, generating ideas about how to apply robotics in their classroom. Using this system, it is possible to transform robotics education by combining knowledge. Even teachers who have never had contact with robotics can start using this technology in the classroom by replicating lessons that are proven to work by other teachers. The system is in the final stages of development to be made available to the educational robotics community.},

  abstract={This paper purports to share with the higher education community the global PBL active learning curriculum and the learning environment, which have been collaboratively developed with the universities in Taiwan and Kansai University (KU). The collaborated universities developed an optimal curriculum to enhance and nurture students' "Future Work Skills 2020" defined by the Institute for the Future, such future human skills as Sense Making, Social Intelligence, Novel & Adaptive Thinking, Cross-Cultural Competencies, Computational Thinking, New Media Literacy, Transdisciplinarity, Design Mindset, Cognitive Load Management, and Virtual Collaboration. The curriculum fully employs PBL strategies in global teams, where teams for PBL are organized with students with heterogeneous cultural backgrounds in the virtual learning environment. The basic concept of such curriculum is based on COIL (Collaborative Online International Learning), originally developed by State University of New York. COIL makes full usage of IT to generate virtual learning environment for students worldwide. In order to go beyond the COIL concept incorporating the future skills defined by IFTF, the allied universities employed PBL in global AGILE teams to deepen insights from various cultural viewpoints in terms of consensus building through team discussions. Due to the spatial and temporal differences, enrolled students conducted their team learning activities in the virtual learning environment asynchronously, making use of IT technologies and cloud services in order to be on "the same page" in the progress of the project throughout the course. Further, the assessment strategies to enhance students' efficacy is the key factor in the course, which is also discussed with examples. This paper reports the global PBL active learning curriculum and environment collaboratively developed with the universities in Taiwan and Kansai University.},

  abstract={In recent years, in all contexts of our lives, we have seen a real explosion of data. From a research standpoint, data processing needs have increasingly become common in an ever growing number of applications, with potential benefits not only in our work but also in our lives: the need not just to acquire, store and perform modest operational tasks but also to analyze and properly interpret data. In this talk, we consider some of the hottest and most demanding scenarios in our daily lives, which include: medical analytics to improve the quality of life of the elderly and reduce health care expenses; social network analytics for enhancing cultural heritage dissemination; exploration of work datafication potential in improving the management of human resources (HRM); game analytics to foster Computational Thinking in education. We describe the recent findings we have obtained in our research in these contexts using the latest technology for data analytics, including interpretable machine learning, and discuss the consequences and directions for the future.},

  abstract={According to the Code.org there are currently 528,174 open computing jobs in U.S. and only 49,291 computer science students graduated into the workforce, last year. In order to try to reverse this scenario, several countries are working on a way to include computer science concepts, like computational thinking, in their curriculums for K-12 education. In addition, many studies and researches are being done related to practices and tools that can be applied in order to retain students that applied for computer science courses. In order to contribute to these initiatives, this paper presents CODEX, an interactive and ludic learning object, that aims to help students that do not need to have a background in programming to learn one of the most important structure in a programming language, the loop. CODEX was designed to be used both in class and in extra-class activity.},

  abstract={A computational thinking under simulated environment with amendable properties is promoted. It is exemplified on a real drum boiler multi-loop linear control. The model is based on the boiler-turbine plant P16/G16, which is oil-fired and the rated power is 160 MW, at the Sydvenska Kraft AB Plant in Malmö, Sweden. A proficient symbolic and numerical combination points out a fast and very efficient automatic engineering calculation. This contribution aims at tailor-made small simulators on Matlab for those industrial processes which are linked by heat energy. A first application at drum boiler with linear control meets a useful know-how to guide thoughts on how to translate physical fundamentals to Matlab codes for other industrial cases. Some comments relating to industrial practice are offered in this context.},

  abstract={The appearance of MOOCs has boosted the creation of educational material for use in all possible contexts. However, this material is often created without much thought and without proper tools and methodologies. Much more attention should be placed on the design of educational material, since this is the basis for a successful learning experience. In this special session, we report about several interesting approaches towards the design and creation of educational material that range from the call to the definition of a discipline of Courseware Engineering, to a methodology for video recording, another one for the creation of smart adaptive content, tools metrics for teaching computational thinking, the integration of OERs, and the design and application of game-based material.},

  abstract={EarSketch lowers the barriers to entry and broadens engagement in computer science through expressive and culturally relevant music composition. In EarSketch, students write computer code to remix sound samples into original music compositions, often within hours of first exposure to the application. Coupled with sound samples rooted in modern music genres, EarSketch generates deep student engagement. We observed two unexpected challenges when implementing EarSketch in high school Computer Science Principles courses. First, music that appeals to the students' generation may be difficult for teachers to appreciate (and vice versa). Second, while a majority of students engaged in music production and coding, we observed that some students fixated on artistic musical expression without engaging in substantial computational thinking. These findings may apply more broadly in computational courses situated in expressive domains and to STEAM courses in general. We conclude with suggested changes to professional development, which may be applied more generally to creative computation and STEAM-based courses.},

  abstract={As a summer camp for middle school and high school students, a new method of learning/teaching computer science was explored: Teaching high schoolers MIT's App Inventor for 2 weeks and then during the following two weeks, having the high schoolers teach middle schoolers ranging from upcoming 6th to 9th graders. The program, App Inventor, simplifies the process of coding, making it an ideal method of teaching beginners the basics of computer programming and computational thinking practice. The simplicity of the program is evident through the rapid learning process of the high schoolers, who were mostly beginners at coding. Additionally, during the process of teaching and helping the middle schooler's debugging session, the high school students were able to properly digest the principles and fundamentals of computer programming by revisiting and teaching what they learned. The students, both the high schoolers and middle schoolers, collaborated in exploring and experimenting with multiple variations of apps that could be made with the given teaching materials. The level of comprehension amongst the middle schoolers was evident through their ability to produce the final products, which ultimately varied depending upon the method of teaching that the high schooler chose to teach with. This paper presents the organization of the summer programming camp, contents and learning outcome.},

  abstract={Computation is becoming an integral part of education, especially at college-level. Two MOOC courses provide an introduction to computation and are offered by MIT on EdX: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python has run 16 times and 6.00.2x Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science has run 11 times. These courses frame the world around computation, and show learners that they can think about problems they see in everyday life in the context of computation. Our paper shows an analysis of repeat learners (learners who enroll in the same course multiple times) and their behaviors over the many runs of these courses. Around 20% of learners in any given run of a course are repeat learners. Of these, the majority are two-time repeat learners (learners who took the same course exactly twice). We show that learners tend to perform better when they retake a course, and especially when they retake the course sooner rather than later. We also look at a subgroup of learners we call repeat cross-referencers (learner who accessed at least two previous runs of the course during the run time of a later run of the course). We found that repeat cross-referencers complete the course at a suspiciously high rate, and we speculate it is because they are looking back at answers from a previous course run. Lastly, we look at how learners perform in an introductory class and an advanced class. We found that many learners who take both courses are more likely to complete both courses and have more active days in the courses than those learners who only do one of the two classes.},

  abstract={Summary form only given, as follows. The H1N1 pandemic of 2009 and the ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa serve as a reminder of the social, economic and health burden of infectious diseases. The ongoing trends towards urbanization, global travel, climate change and a generally older and immuno-compromised population continue to make epidemic planning and control challenging. Recent quantitative changes in high performance pervasive computing have created new opportunities for collecting, integrating, analyzing and accessing information related to large urban social systems, disease surveillance and global logistics and supply chains. The advances in network and information science that build on this new capability provide entirely new ways for reasoning and controlling epidemics. In this talk I will overview of the state of the art in computational networked epidemiology with an emphasis on computational thinking and on the development of high performance computing oriented decision-support environments for planning and response in the event of epidemics. I will describe how such systems can be used to support near real-time planning and response during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu and the recent Ebola Outbreak in West Africa. Computational challenges and directions for future research will be discussed.},

As English, is important to include it as early as possible in teaching programs, right from preschool.

  abstract={The demand for cybersecurity professionals is projected to grow substantially, with the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting that employment in cybersecurity within the US will grow by 18% from 2014 to 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations. As creating a cyberspace workforce has become a matter of national security for every country, cybersecurity needs to be taught at all levels, to all students, in the educational system. The good news is that cybersecurity is also a topic that students from a wide variety of backgrounds find interesting, and as a result, it motivates them to study computing too. Over the past two decades, there has been an increased effort worldwide to incorporate computer science and computational thinking into the middle and high school curriculum. The CS10K initiative in the US has led to projects to introduce computer science at the K-12 educational level. One of these initiatives, the new Advanced Placement (AP) course in Computer Science Principles (CSP), was designed to introduce computer science in an engaging way, show students how computing is relevant in their lives, and to attract a diverse group of students to computing. The CSP Curriculum Framework allows for multiple implementations of the CSP course, permitting course designers to develop courses to engage and attract specific groups of students and that focus on specific themes in computing. This paper describes an approach to develop a new CSP course, CyberCSP, which integrates cybersecurity first principles throughout the course. The approach builds on an CSP course that was created from a previous collaboration between the Computer Science Department at Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, New York, and the Webster Central School District in Webster, New York. The paper discusses the background, details of the earlier CSP course, how relevant cybersecurity content was identified, and then integrated into the CSP course to create the CyberCSP variant of the Computer Science Principles course.},

While some academic departments incorporate software like R or Python in coursework and research, many students remain reliant on self-teaching in order to gain the necessary skills to work with their data. However, given the growing number of students interested in computational tools and resources for research automation, relying on student self-teaching and learning is not an efficient method for training the next generation of scholars. To address the educational need for computational thinking and learning across various academic departments on campus, the UC San Diego Library has been running Software Carpentry workshops (two day bootcamps to introduce foundational programming concepts and best practices) since 2015. The Library, as a discipline-agnostic entity with a history of serving as a trusted resource for information, has been well positioned to provide training for this new era of research methodology. The core of our success is the collaboration with the growing community of Software and Data Carpentry instructors at UC San Diego with expertise in various research disciplines. Building on this strong partnership and leveraging the Library's resources and expertise in digital literacy, the campus can better support data-driven and technologically-focused education and research.},

  abstract={The Creative Computing Challenge (CCC) project (2014-2018) is funded by the National Science Foundation and is designed to broaden participation in computing by providing professional development (PD) for high school teachers at Career & Technical Education (CTE) programs throughout the state of New Hampshire. Teachers receive a stipend and tablets for their classrooms; they attend several in-person PD sessions through the year, where master teachers and PD facilitators introduce modeling of inquiry and equity-based practices, as well as teach the App Inventor tool and how to inculcate computational thinking in students. Project evaluation has included teacher interviews, classroom and PD observations, as well as student and teacher surveys. External evaluation of this project has been an integral part of the project from the beginning and, along with the project team’s observations and input, has significantly reshaped the project activities. It became clear after the first year that a central challenge of this project would be working with a mix of teachers across multiple domains – from teachers who had little experience even using computers to teachers who had computer science degrees; from teachers who came to teaching from professional backgrounds to those who had education degrees; and from beginning teachers to those who had been teaching the same courses for twenty years. Through evaluation data and really listening to teacher feedback, we not only tailored the PD content and structure, but also refined the data collection instruments and evaluation design to bridge the gap between different teacher experiences and levels of preparation. As a result, we have been able to bring computing into non-technical content areas such as Hospitality and non-programming classes such as Photography, as well as support computing educations in New Hampshire CTE programs. In Year 4, we now better understand the range of benefits and challenges involved in working with CTE programs and inserting CCC-inspired curricular modules in non-computing courses.},

  abstract={With the development of science and technology, many industries begin to use computer technology to improve work efficiency. From the facts of many practices, we can see that computer technology is a good technology for many industries and can bring many benefits to the industry. Computer technology is also deepening into legal practice. In legal practice, modeling, simulation and other calculation methods can be used to analyze legal relations, so that legal information can be transformed from traditional analysis to an information and intelligent system with higher efficiency and accuracy. The inclusion classification in legal procedures can be simply summarized as a model, and the eigenvalue table structure is built to make the case enter the computer into data that can be calculated and judged. This method simplifies the case trial and makes the case context clearer. The deep integration of Computational Thinking and legal thinking is conducive to enrich and develop the basic theory of law, improve the scientificity and coordination of various departments in the judicial system, and improve the efficiency of the judicial system. Computer technology plays a positive role in improving legislative and judicial efficiency, coping with and avoiding technical risks.},

  abstract={This study explores interactions between computational thinking, gender and engineering identity among biomedical engineering undergraduate students. Biomedical engineering enjoys higher rates of women's enrollment than other engineering disciplines, but nevertheless has gender disparities in persistence within the field. Additionally, trends towards greater incorporation of computation into biomedical engineering have the potential to recreate the gender inequities seen in more computationally intensive engineering disciplines. Recently, `engineering identity' has emerged as a powerful analytic lens to understand persistence in engineering, particularly for underrepresented groups such as women. However, there is limited work examining how experiences using computational methods influences engineering identity formation in undergraduate biomedical engineers. Further, it remains unclear to what extent gender differentially mediates the effects of computational practice on engineering identity formation. In order to explore the intersection of these issues, we study a thermodynamics course in the biomedical engineering department of a large Midwestern public research institution in the United States. The thermodynamics course includes in-class computational modeling group activities and has an enrollment of more than 120, primarily sophomore year, undergraduate students. We use a qualitative study approach that includes gathering data through classroom observation and detailed semi-structured interviews. We analyze classroom observation data to try to understand student experiences of learning and participation during in-class computational modeling exercises. Specifically, we look for evidence of gendered differences in task sorting and engagement with the exercise. Classroom data is complemented by semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews gains student's perspectives on how gender has influenced their learning experience and their identity as engineers.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) is successfully intervening in areas such as education, health and industry. In education, AI is being used to improve educational processes. UNESCO considers as a new vision to involve AI not only as a didactic medium, but also as a science in which children can develop their intellect, through workshops, courses and curricula focused on the fundamentals of AI, allowing them to develop skills such as computational thinking and critical thinking. The present Systematic Literature Review was developed according to the methodological guidelines proposed by Barbara Kitchenham, with the objective of identifying how AI teaching-learning processes are carried out from early ages. Sixty-four studies were obtained between 2016-2021, where eleven countries are identified with AI teaching initiatives, through workshops, courses and projects to update their curricula; machine learning and educational robotics are the two branches linked to AI that are currently taught to children and adolescents.},
