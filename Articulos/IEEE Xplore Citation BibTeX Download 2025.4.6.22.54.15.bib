  abstract={Students' emotional state plays a vital role in learning. In this study, we examined the emotional changes of 69 students during the lectures of the C Language Programming Foundation and Computational Thinking in central China. This paper presents a method using Yolov7 and the convolutional neural network CoAtNet to monitor students' emotional evolution by analyzing their facial expressions and recognizing academic affective states, including boring, confused, focus, happy, and neutral. The trained model has achieved a test accuracy of 76.0%. The results showed that focus increased at the beginning of the first 10 minutes of class and then began to decline. With the decline of focus emotion, students' neutral emotions increased. We found that when a new teaching session is performed, or the teaching method of naming questions is used, the students' emotion of focus increases briefly, lasting about 8–10 minutes. Subsequently, even if the varied teaching method was used to stimulate students' attention, their level of engagement did not increase significantly. It can be suggested that teachers can use teaching methods appropriately to promote students' attention. However, students' attention span is limited, and teachers should pay attention to methods and time to improve teaching quality effectively.},

The existing literature suggests that Scratch programming language may have a strong influence on the skills acquired by students in classroom. In this context, it is intended to build an intervention with objectives that fit into the Student Profile leaving compulsory education and developed within the scope of curricular flexibility, recommended for the 1st year of basic education. The applied methodology aims to evaluate the impact on students' knowledge (mathematics and mother tongue), attitudes (in relation to knowledge and citizenship) and on the capacities (cognitive, emotional and practical) as well as in the school community (students, teachers and families).},

  abstract={Minecraft is one of the most popular games among youth today, experiencing sales over 100 million worldwide and channels on YouTube generating over 47 billion views. Our interest in the game environment is due to its innate computational mechanics that integrate logic, design, and scripting elements. Because of these traits, many organizations and schools are looking to incorporate Minecraft into their curriculum to support computational thinking and computational practices. However, there are challenges surrounding the distribution and availability of individuals who possess the technical and computational expertise needed to support these opportunities. In this poster we introduce the DYN Minecraft Server project. The project is designed to address barriers of entry for adults at schools and youth-serving organizations who want to provide computing-related learning opportunities to diverse youth. We worked with families, city organizations, mentors, and youth to modify the commercially available Minecraft to support adults who may have limited expertise in computing or Minecraft, yet wish to use the platform in order to teach computational content The modifications include the integration of an information network that promotes STEM learning opportunities that are available throughout the city. We discuss our design process, designed activities and interfaces, and feedback from youth, partners, and mentors using the system.},

  abstract={This paper discusses how a connection between programming and creative work in terms of visual and interactive art can be of interest in the educational context of learning programming. There are strong indications that a creative approach in programming allows to pay attention to institutional and social requirements concerning computer science education. This includes the students' interest and motivation as well as their performance and knowledge acquisition. Even though, this has been discussed before, this paper presents a first basic structure of a didactic concept, enabling an integration of creative coding as an additional path for teaching computer science in schools in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Taking existing approaches into account, basic ideas of creative coding are identified and connected to the concepts of Computational Thinking.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of science and technology over the world, programming education has shown as a trend in decades. Programming courses have been offered in primary education to promote students’ computational thinking skills. However, teaching and learning programming in primary schools involve different knowledge including complex mathematical concepts and programming syntax. Also, traditional teaching methods may not effectively cater for students’ individual needs and learning trajectories. Thus, learning difficulties are common among students. Teachers keep examining innovation on programming education to improve their teaching. This study investigated used a pretest-posttest method with two groups of grade five students in Macao, to compare the influence of two pedagogical strategies, flipped classroom and traditional teaching, in students’ learning achievements. The major findings of the study showed that the experimental group in flipped classroom had significantly higher learning achievements than the control group in the programming course. Moreover, the students in the flipped classroom showed a significant effective mastery of more complex programming concepts, such as conditions and loops.},

  abstract={How can learning be computed? Curriculum, using visual language as the motivational context with embedded computer science content was utilized in one college computer science class and two middle school technology classes. From the data collected in these three classes over the course of a semester, associated learning progressions were computed from several computational thinking patterns. By comparing the results (learning progressions), some obvious and some not so obvious indications emerged. We believe that the more obvious indications give credence to the less obvious, and hence the measurement tool. This comparison between middle school students and college students demonstrated that middle school students' learning progressions are slower than college level students (obvious), but middle school students' learning skill scores reached/surpassed the entry level scores of students in the college class after designing only two or more games. Consequently, these results tell us that this measurement tool although not validated yet, could measure accumulated learning in certain contexts. Although this is just the first "outing" of this tool these results strongly indicate that the tool provides an accurate measure of the concept, in this case, learning accumulation or transfer. The Scalable Game Design (SGD) project was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to improve computer science interest in middle schools. The goal of SGD is to use visual language programming software (Agentsheets) to introduce a more positive image of computer science through a game design course.},

Of particular interest to us are robots for education. In general, educational robotics kits are expensive and proprietary, or cheap and unreliable. This research seeks to bridge that gap by providing a hands on open-source robotics learning environment that is both inexpensive and reliable. In this paper, we review the applicability of such environments to support the synergistic learning of computational thinking (CT) and STEM, with an emphasis on Computer Science (CS) concepts and practices. The CT and Advanced Placement CS Principles frameworks (from the US) govern the design and implementation of our system. We discuss the hardware system of the robot and the accompanying software architecture that runs on Linux-based single board computers. We conclude with results from a small pilot study analyzing the usability and curricular effectiveness of the system.},

  abstract={Lacking student preparation before class has been the most commonly identified challenge when adopting the flipped classroom approach. In this study, we have introduced a class activity which can increase student pre-class online engagement and help them better prepare for the in-class activity. During this activity, students are required to work in small groups before in-class activities to answer open-ended questions related to the course learning materials via an online shared document. Based on teachers' duty, there are four stages for implementation of the proposed activity which are: (1) initiation: teacher needs to design open-ended questions and creates online shared editable documents for each group; (2) scaffolding: teacher assists learners in providing responses by checking their editing logs; (3) assessment: students' access to the online shared documents will be suspended and teacher will evaluate students responses; and (4) reflection: teacher will address common issues and propose more challenging questions before the related in-class activities. We have conducted experiments in the third cohort of a flipped general education course on computational thinking and algorithms. Except for the proposed class activity, the first two cohorts of this course have the same design and content in three topics and therefore worked as control groups. Online interaction data of all three cohorts have been collected for a thorough comparison. Results showed that students' average lecture video access rates have improved in the third cohort compared to the first two cohorts by 49 % and 39 % respectively. The percentage of students who never accessed any lecture videos decreased from around 29 % in the first and second cohorts to 6 % in the third cohort where the proposed activity was implemented. A statistically significant difference was discovered between the first and third cohorts (t = -15.06, p<; 0.00001), and between the second and third cohorts (t = _27.02, p<; 0.00001) of the course in lecture video access rates.},

Findings indicated a competent level in Professional Engagement, yet they revealed that teachers are still at initial stages regarding the integration of digital tools in teaching and the use of open educational resources. Although variables like gender, age, and academic background showed no significant differences, it was noted that both the technological infrastructure of institutions and support for professional development positively impact digital competences. This underlines the importance of reinforcing educational policies related to training and digital resources to promote a substantial improvement in mathematics teaching, as a key factor for the development of students’ critical and computational thinking.},

  abstract={In 2021, the first year of Metaverse, Web3.0 ecosystems emerged as a result of the Internet's de-centralized evolution. In the Web3.0 space, there has been a very active advancement of the generative art non-fungible token, which is a special asset stored on a blockchain that allows creators to buy and sell assets and verify ownership. In other words, as it reconstructs the interpersonal relationship, the generative art non-fungible token must carry cultural values to be meaningful, and waiting to observe artificial intelligence generative art in the future requires a new mindset and posture. Design thinking is a design-based approach to solve today's complex problems. This study thus addresses the new Web3.0 ecosystem and introduces environmental sustain ability issues and computational thinking in the form of generative art to discuss the possibilities of future design thinking. By linking with social information, this study also creates an intersection with heterogeneous knowledge and stimulates a new thinking pattern that is different from previous ones. This project of design and research in the Metaverse virtual environment is still a novel topic. Reviewing past literature indicates that relevant papers are very scarce, and more resources are urgently needed for research in this field.},

The game challenges players to rearrange a sequence of unsorted aliens by using a set of commands, such as comparing, swapping, and moving. The game also records players’ actions and performance through log data, which can be analyzed for learning behavior, and outcomes. It describes the game design and development process, as well as the potential benefits and limitations of using the game in computer science education, and also discusses how the game can facilitate the development of computational thinking skills such as problem formulation, abstraction, algorithmic thinking, and generalization.},

  abstract={An increasing number of tools have been created to assist students in learning mathematics. Robots have been regarded as an especially powerful tool to help students master mathematics since students can simultaneously learn mathematics, programming, robotic control, and computational thinking. Although a number of educational robots and curricula have been developed, some of them do not comply with math standards, so they are primarily suitable for after-school programs, camps, or workshops. Students might not be able to focus on learning mathematics now that writing a program might be difficult for them due to debugging. In this paper, mathematics curricula that meet math standards are developed with a block-based programming platform, Roboblocky. Linkbots are utilized as robots in the curricula to teach and learn mathematics in school settings. Students learn mathematics by observing the motions of robots in simulations or on real mats. Most students improved greatly in mathematics after using the curricula. It is expected that the curricula based on Roboblocky will continue to be improved to enable more middle and high school students to be successful in learning mathematics.},

Many innovative technologies have emerged including artificial intelligence, biomedical engineering, automation systems, quantum computing, big data, blockchain, etc. These emerging technologies have also transformed our lifestyles. This transformation has then inevitably required a new set of skills; Computational Thinking/Logical Thinking which can be compiled into Coding skills. Several novel educational media and teaching materials have been promoted. Current educational kits in the market can be classified into 3 main categories. These structures vary from physical kits vs virtual kits vs hybrid kits, while coding styles vary from block-based vs text-based. This paper presents an educational multi-purpose kit for coding and robotic design which has a hybrid kits structure with block-based coding style. Its connection scheme has been designed as wired/wireless plug-and-play via magnetic. The implemented prototype could be resilient for various learning activities, including emulating three (touch, hearing and sight) out of five basic human senses via sensors and actuators. A use case on shape recognition, using computer vision, has been illustrated to show how the implemented system works.},

  abstract={A quantum self-organizing feature mapping network model and clustering algorithm are proposed. The inputs and weights of quantum neurons are quantum bits, and the output is real numbers. The characteristics and relationship of BOPPPS model and problem-driven teaching method are studied, BOPPPS model and teaching method The relationship between elements 5W, and taking the "Algorithm and Data Structure" course as an example, gives strategies and practices for cultivating computational thinking. The quantum self-organizing feature map network is composed of input layer and competition layer. The multi-objective programming model is established by mathematical methods such as linear weighting, objective programming and hierarchical sequence, and the solution to the dynamic allocation of resources in the logistics network is given by analyzing the model.},

  abstract={This paper deals with a progress report on the execution of the sense making in the curriculum development for global AGILE Problem-Based Learning incorporating computational thinking enhanced with ICT, which has been based on the collaborative endeavors between School of Business Management at Nanyang Polytechnic University in Singapore (NPU) and Center for Teaching and Learning at Kansai University (KU), intending to foster the Vision 2020 skills as well as the future work skills defined by Institute of the Future. Although Problem-Based Learning has been ubiquitous in the realm of the face-to-face onsite learning environment, the project is based on PBL in which project team members with common interests in entrepreneurship from both universities organize several teams to aim for startup business plans with simulation in the virtual learning environment. The paper will walk readers through the rationale behind such curriculum as well as the entire process of the curriculum development from the initial preparation to the final product including the assessment. The key factors of such curriculum development are elaborated in the conclusion.},

  pages={346-351},
  abstract={The “C Language Programming” course is a specialized elective for 33 non-computer undergraduate majors in 9 faculties of our university. It aims to develop students ’ computational thinking. And it aims to make student’s ability to solve practical problems using computer programs. In response to the pain points of “significant differences in student basic knowledge and difficulty in unifying teaching difficulty” in teaching content, teaching evaluation methods, and teacher-student teaching and learning, the teaching method based on TPACK has been adopted. Following the educational philosophy of “output oriented and continuous improvement”, the subject teaching knowledge has been integrated. With the help of modern information technology, based on various integrated teaching modes of online and offline, and of class and extracurricular, a corresponding teaching environment has been constructed, curriculum ideological and political education has been strengthened, and a diversified assessment and evaluation system has been constructed. Based on the above research, multiple disciplinary competition awards have been obtained. Teaching practice has proven that the above teaching methods effectively solve pain points. The transformation has been achieved from traditional classrooms to smart classrooms, from knowledge classrooms to ability classrooms, and from indoctrination classrooms to innovative classrooms. The students ’ learning interest and self-learning abilities have been enhanced. The students’ ability to apply knowledge, solve problems, perform hands-on operations, and cooperate in teams have been developed. The students' patriotism has been cultivated. The correct life values of students has been shaped. The students' innovative thinking and determination to challenge themselves have been stimulated.},

  abstract={The Ministry of Information Technology, Information and Communication, under the aegis of the Mauritian government aims at developing digital learning to improve the potential of Mauritian students for the future. As the country posits itself as a cyber-island with a fully developed information technology hub, it has become imperative to think about leveraging the teaching of computer science in lower secondary schools (Grades 7-9). So far, this has been limited to basic courses in computing that are essentially theory focused. This paper states that students at this stated level need to develop `computational thinking' so that they are ready for the workplace and will effectively enter the digital world. It limits itself to two key variables resource leveraging and teaching computing. In the first case, it raises arguments on programming languages, hardware and software that might apply to students in the new curriculum. In the teaching area, the paper suggests that a combination of teaching programming, inclusion and informal learning will be the possibilities to accompany students overcome the digital divide and get the opportunity to become effective as learners and trained ICT students to serve their nation.},
