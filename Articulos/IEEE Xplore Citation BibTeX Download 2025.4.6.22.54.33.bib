  abstract={Dynamic geometry systems (DGS) are widely used in mathematics education to enhance students' thinking skills through geometric exploration. Integrating programming into DGS fosters both mathematical and computational thinking. However, research on reverse debugging design for programmable dynamic geometry systems is limited, and existing systems fail to meet the needs for operation reversal. To address this, this paper proposes a programming environment that supports reverse debugging, aiming to overcome the limitations of current programmable dynamic geometry systems in debugging. We abstracted dynamic geometry operations and defined three types of drawing instructions. To ensure sequential execution and debugging, we designed a debuggable sequential execution algorithm, followed by a reverse debugging control algorithm. The effectiveness of the system is verified by experiments.},

  abstract={This research to practice work in progress has two main objectives: i) the improvement of interdisciplinary teaching and learning processes in an integrated course of informatics in high school course and; ii) turning students into learners by the designing and development of innovative features for m-learning applications. Such objectives are integrated each other, since the improvement in the teaching and learning processes will not be restricted in the proposal and use of a practical framework for the improvement of students' skills in the computational thinking, but also in the use of the m-learning features and applications to improve educational issues faced by both students and teachers. In this perspective, active-learning and problem-based learning theories were considered to support the proposal of a series of activities composing a framework to be adopted to achieve the target objectives. The interdisciplinary teaching and learning processes improvement has its roots at the proposal of solutions for problems into disciplines of high school curricula through the innovative m-learning features to be designed and developed by the students. In this paper it is discussed the motivations about the proposal of this project, the teaching and learning implications in the context of a integrated course of informatics in high school course, its planning and a pilot conduction of mainly initial activities with the volunteers students. Such activities include: (a) the identification of problems and the planning of solutions based on m-learning features; (b) the design and development phases of an initial set features; and (c) a preliminary evaluation of usability of some mockups of m-learning application. At the end, the identified evidence are discussed, mainly those related with the implications for the interdisciplinary scenario for the teaching and learning processes, the initial identification of benefits in the perspective of the participation of students as learners and the future work, as well.},

  abstract={How do Oprah, the multimedia mogul, and Edison, the inventor of the telephone, both inspire teachers and students to learn computational thinking? A CS/CT focused module was developed by two grade 4 teachers that would introduce culturally relevant role models to students in an urban school district. The module engages students through a “Choose Your Own Adventure” activity focusing on perseverance and conditionals. Students create Scratch projects, using a Makey Makey, to model what would happen if one of their historical role models gave up on their dreams. This module is just one example of the nineteen modules created by members of CSforALL Springfield, a Research Practice Partnership working with the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, Massachusetts. The partnership allows for collaboration between educators from Springfield, MA Public Schools and Researchers from the University. We will spotlight this module to show how the module was designed and taught to make it an engaging, equitable learning experience for all students and share their learning outcomes along the way. Our goal is to share how we designed and integrated culturally responsive Computer Science curriculum at the elementary level that will ensure equitable learning for all students. Our goal is to show how we engaged dyads in a design based collaborative process to produce a module for their grade level.},

  abstract={The Department of Computer Science at Hampton University was awarded the HBCU-UP TIP Project to reform three gateway courses and implement an intensive computing summer bridge program (SBP) in an effort to improve student academic performance and increase retention and graduation rates in the major. By integrating Computational Thinking into lower-level courses, the proposed project also seeks to strengthen Computer Science students and better prepare them to meet the modern demands in the field. In the first year of the project there have been several changes to the curriculum content of the gateway courses as well as the implementation of the summer pre-college program. The summer 2014 was the first computing pre-college program. There were nineteen participants currently in the summer program. The students were engaged and excited to be a part of this program. The Computer Science Seminar course served as the initiative for a supplemental undergraduate research award request. The course focused not only ensuring the students understand computer science as a field of study, but also how computer science impacts all fields of study and everything in their daily lives. There were several speakers, FBI, Industry, University faculty, and previous graduates. The initial results has been extremely rewarding as we noticed from their performance in the first semester program course, CS1. This poster will discuss the curriculum we used during the summer program, sample exercises, feedback from students as well as lesson learnt for us to improve next year program.},

That is, under the teaching objectives and principles based on market demand, the teaching contents should be integrated, the practice teaching should be strengthened, multi-dimensional hybrid teaching methods and procedural assessment should be used for the purpose of stimulating students' interests, keeping high motivation. Finally, it can mobilize students' enthusiasm for independent learning, and cultivating their ability to solve complex professional problems with computational thinking.},

  abstract={Computer science unplugged (CS unplugged) is a method of teaching computer science and computational thinking. The aim of our study is to illustrate program behavior and to prevent confusion about the program stack through visualization. To facilitate recognition, we used a toy consisting of a ball, pipes, and magnetic panels. The ball represents which line of code is executed, similar to the program counter. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, we present three examples based on the proposed method. The examples are necessity of loop to wait user input, necessity of loop to keep program running, and software testing. We conducted an experiment with nine participants to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The result suggested that the proposed method is expected to be effective.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-4},
  abstract={The STEM methodology has been applied in different study approaches, covering different areas such as arts, internet of things, computational thinking, among others. In this paper, two necessary approaches are addressed for the implementation of a closed-loop control system. The first approach (programming) is directly related to the software implementation and the second approach addresses the hardware instrumentation part. Both approaches are developed in a practical teaching case, from a STEM Maker workshop which consisted of 15 sessions with duration 2 hours each one. Each session consisted of 4 stages: Stage 1 (Theoretical concepts), Stage 2 (Practical Example), Stage 3 (Practice) and Stage 4 (challenge). Through these four stages, the development of skills of the attendees in the areas of programming and electronics was encouraged, applying the STEM Maker strategy. From some evaluation instruments, data was collected about the development of skills of the assistants in the implementation of software and hardware instrumentation, acquired in the STEM Maker workshop. The results indicated that approximately 70% of the workshop attendees developed the necessary skills to propose solutions to problems in their current context where the application of programming and/or electronics intervenes. The product obtained from the practice is described as a temperature control which integrates a feedback signal, this system has a wide field of applications which allowed the students of the STEM Maker workshop to achieve a project related to the individual context of each one.},

  abstract={Computational thinking has become pervasive across many technical and creative disciplines. Creating a computationally literate workforce capable of recognizing and eliminating algorithmic discrimination requires diverse perspectives and lived experiences. Diversity within computing is a persistent problem; in 2014, several large tech companies released diversity reports and made commitments to improvement. As of 2020, improvements have been minor, especially for Black employees. Compared to US demographics, the percentage of Black and Latinx students pursuing degrees in computing remains low, even as numbers improve in STEM more broadly. It is more important than ever to prioritize a diverse computing workforce and a computationally literate workforce, more broadly, whose interests reside with equitable outcomes.},

  abstract={The programming education for the students set off a global enthusiasm. The Block-Python programming tools can fill the gap from block-based programming to language coding. However, there is little work focus on the evaluation metrics for block-based python code. The past block-oriented evaluation metrics based on Computational Thinking (CT) were not language-oriented, and program volume was often ignored. In this paper, we propose a new evaluation metrics for block-based python code, which combines the CT dimensions and program volume. The experimental results show that the correlations between the proposed metrics and Halstead, McCabe complexity algorithms are both above 0.7, which is higher than Dr. Scratch.},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Objective: The objective of this paper is to present preliminary work on the development of an EduChatBot tool and the measurement of the effects of its use aimed at providing effective feedback to programming course students. This bot, hereinafter referred to as tutorBot+, was constructed based on chatGPT3.5 and is tasked with assisting and providing timely positive feedback to students in computer science programming courses at UCSC. Methods/Analysis: The proposed method consists of four stages: (1) Immersion in the feedback and Large Language Models (LLMs) topic; (2) Development of tutorBot+ prototypes in both non-conversational and conversational versions; (3) Experiment design; and (4) Intervention and evaluation. The first stage involves a literature review on feedback and learning, the use of intelligent tutors in the educational context, as well as the topics of LLMs and chatGPT. The second and third stages detail the development of tutorBot+ in its two versions, and the final stage lays the foundation for a quasi-experimental study involving students in the curriculum activities of Programming Workshop and Database Workshop, focusing on learning outcomes related to the development of computational thinking skills, and facilitating the use and measurement of the tool’s effects. Findings: The preliminary results of this work are promising, as two functional prototypes of tutorBot+ have been developed for both the non-conversational and conversational versions. Additionally, there is ongoing exploration into the possibility of creating a domain-specific model based on pretrained models for programming, integrating tutorBot+ with other platforms, and designing an experiment to measure student performance, motivation, and the tool’s effectiveness.},

As a result, this study is to constructing a series of programming competence indicator for K-12 students by adopting Delphi study technique. This study invites 15 experts including experienced elementary and high schools teachers, to survey and provide suggestions for this indicator. After three rounds of Delphi study, this study completed 5-level programming competence, including detailed content of indicators, learning and instructional methods, and learning environments.

  abstract={The programming language Python is simple and easy to learn and is used for students with no prior background in programming. Several colleges and universities teach Python to students who are learning a programming language for the first time. In this paper, we present a curricular model for introducing, through active learning strategies, data analytics concepts and applications into an introductory computer science course for non-majors. We have designed the course to use a variety of hands-on laboratory projects that use the Python programming language and associated tools. While introducing students to an important research area, we believe the use of these projects improves students’ learning experiences, enables them to apply and relate fundamental computational thinking concepts of algorithmic reasoning, data representation, and computational efficiency to data analytics problems. Assessment results show that introducing data analytics concepts and applications through active learning strategies enhanced students’ computing capability to solve problems.},

In order to offer effective and meaningful Professional Development (PD) sessions, our research team first intended to understand the perceptions and experiences of K-8 teachers about Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) education. This paper presents the results of a K-8 teacher survey that we conducted as a pre-cursor to our PD series. The results of this survey provided valuable insights about elementary and middle-school teachers' perceptions of computer science education, self-perception of their ability to teach and learn CS, and understanding of CS discipline and those who typically engage in CS activities. The impact of teachers' perceptions impact how leaders in education and the CS industry can meet the needs of teachers, who in turn can meet the growing demand of CS education in K-8 schools.},

A high school student probably gets frustrated by questions like these on the ground that inquiries in arithmetic. The idea of implementing hacking on a smart car should improve student’s interest and motivate them to pursue careers in STEM-related areas. However, if the same example was demonstrated to them using a smart car prototype which was hacked, then there is a good chance they can get attracted towards Technology and Computing. When similar examples, involving the various other topics in their syllabus, are shown, they’ll probably get to see the real-life applications of the topics they study during high school and after that. This paper introduces a new attempt that aims at inclining the interest of high school students towards the courses in the STEM (which have an escalating carrier aspect), improving their computational thinking capability, and making them aware of today’s cybersecurity issues.},

The design of the planning tool was informed by prior research and literature on concept development. The tool scaffolded the design process by having students (1) describe their game, (2) identify agents, (3) describe agent behavior, and (4) use those descriptions to identify useful algorithms. The set of algorithms used were called computational thinking patterns (CTPs), and sample code was provided for each CTP to assist the programming process. From the information provided by the student a summary was created to show needed agents and helpful programming code.},

  abstract={Today, principles of finance are combined with advanced mathematical structures to form useful financial products, strategies and models that are tested and implemented with the use of advanced quantitative techniques. Use of computing technology is pervasive throughout this process. Quantitative and Computational Finance is an area referred to under a variety of names, for example, ‘computational finance’, ‘financial engineering’, and ‘mathematical finance’. But in all cases there is an effort that involves ‘financial’, ‘mathematical’, ‘quantitative’ and ‘computational’ thinking to build, test and implement models that are at the center of these financial activities. In the last decade Computational Finance (CF) has influenced the market place extensively with enormous impact on wealth building, employment opportunities, and tremendous economic growth. This field forms an ever-expanding part of the financial sector, in numerous ways today. The time is, therefore, ripe now to bring together researchers in the areas of finance using complicated financial models to solve computationally intensive problems and computer scientists having the resources and solution methodologies to solve such problems. The main goal of this workshop is to provide a timely forum for these two groups to exchange and disseminate new ideas, techniques, and research in computational finance. Strong discussions will follow the presentations and the experience could lead them into the formulation, implementation of the models used by the practitioners in financial sector. This workshop will be a first such effort in bringing together researchers in the areas of finance and advanced computing (i) who develop and employ parallel and distributed computing extensively (ii) at a venue where parallel, distributed, high performance computing is the fundamental thread of discussions and arguments.},

Yet, the field of computer science has progressed enormously since the 1970s: multi-core computing, distributed systems, and machine learning are now ubiquitous, and have deep philosophical and practical ramifications for computer science education, including our definitions of what computational thinking is, and for how we design new programming languages, including visual languages. I will compare the current state of the art of novice programming tools and theories to the current state of computer science, and describe how new conceptual frameworks and visual programming tools could support contemporary computer science education.},

  abstract={This paper, in the domain of digital media, introduces the theoretical basis of possibilistic art. It models the bases of visual art in the atmosphere of possibilistic thought and the fuzzy geometry by introducing meaningful forms and introduces a way for recording and displaying emotional-behavioral responses of artist in the visualcomputational space. Finally, as a function of presented concepts, the paper introduces a semi-algorithm for meaningful deformation. This article, by representation of a method based on the eastern thinking and a computational thinking of the west, make a step in the way of eliminating the theoretic and instrumental shortages of visual arts of Iran in the grounds of computational arts.},

  abstract={A critical barrier in providing computer science learning opportunities to all is the dearth of professionals who have the expertise to teach computer science. Blended learning approaches have the potential to reduce this barrier by facilitating the distribution of expertise across distances. In this poster we present our approach to understanding how to design blended learning models for the informal space that take advantage of the expertise of adult mentors and computer science experts. Our theoretical framing is based on Nacu et al. (2014) adult mentor roles, which suggest that adults play different roles (e.g., encourager, monitor, broker) to support students learning. We use Minecraft, a popular, 3D, online, multiplayer game, as our study context. The poster presents two studies that investigate ways of facilitating mentorship in a blended learning environment to teach computational thinking. Study 1 focuses on documenting the roles mentors play while facilitating a computer science-related Minecraft workshop with middle school students. Study 2 focuses on understanding how these roles are modified when online and in person mentors work together to facilitate a computational learning opportunity. Our initial findings suggest that defining a scalable model to support blended learning models in informal spaces requires a variety of mentor roles. Additionally, when coordinating mentorship across mediums, gaps in student support can arise when there is a lack of (a) explicit strategies of communication in place between in-person and online mentors; and (b) clearly defined roles assigned to mentors.},

  abstract={Technological devices programmed through parallel computing are increasingly present in people's daily lives. They are responsible for processing images that we see on computers, televisions, cell phones and games. It is a fact that parallel processing is a reality, so computer professionals need to know the peculiarities of this form of programming. However, teaching parallel computing is not a simple task, the computational thinking parallel is quite different from that for the sequential processing. This work, then proposes a new methodology for teaching parallel computing for young beginners in programming. Our technique is based on principles of unplugged computing, like to learn doing and playing. We believe that unplugged computing can be very useful in teaching the difficult concepts of parallel computing 1},

  abstract={New (interdisciplinary) Computer Science (CS) subjects in K-12 education have been introduced in recent years. Most of them have educational plans derived from CS Frame-works such as the K-12 CS Framework. To some extent the educational plans have the same core topic areas: data and coding (including data compression and data structures), algorithms (in-volving variables and software projects), computers and networks (covering topics like logic tables and data transmission) and information society and data security (consisting of collection and processing of personal data and asymmetric encryption). Various Computer Science assessment tests such as the SCS1, MG-CSCI, PSIv1 and the Fairy Assessment have been developed for different age groups. These tests mostly include computational thinking, programming or topics that could be categorized in the first two core topic areas data and coding and algorithms. Hence, the research desideratum was to develop a test specifically for measuring the four core topic areas. These core topic areas are part of the educational plan of the new interdisciplinary subject IMP (Informatics, Mathematics, Physics) for secondary schools in Germany. The test was piloted with 156 (m = 117, f = 37, o = 2) 10th grade students, approximately aged 16 at the end of the lower secondary level. We used the Item-Response-Theory (IRT) to validate the test. This work in progress paper presents translated items and the psychometric evaluation of the piloted test. The contribution for both researchers and educators in the CS education research field is the set of items of the research-based CS test in the four core topic areas for 10th grade students that includes item sets for the areas computers and networks and information society and data security.},

  abstract={In order to further improve the level of new engineering professional construction and enhance students' practical programming and innovation capabilities, we carried out teaching reform and practice for the algorithm design and analysis course. Under the guidance of output-oriented and student-centered teaching concept, we analyzed the problems existing in the traditional teaching process of the course, and built up a new course teaching model from the aspects of classroom teaching, course content, teacher-student communication, course assessment, computational thinking as well as moral education. Since the implementation of the new teaching model, the students' grades and learning enthusiasm of this course have been greatly improved, and they have won excellent results in many national algorithm competitions.},
