  abstract={Learning how to program has become a trend in Taiwan even for younger students. IoT is a topic to interest new learners in programming. Given the fact that there are already plenty of tools e.g. Micro:bit and Arduino designed to make IoT programming simple and full of fun, it is usually believed that adopting IoT topics is beneficial for younger students learning how to program. However, younger students’ learning performance in programming courses varies dramatically depending on the tools mentioned above. There are many metrics to predict the academic achievements of young students. Among them, the operation span is an objective one. Operation span mainly assesses one’s working memory capacity. According to the research results, one’s working memory capacity predicts individual high-level cognitive performance. Furthermore, students’ cognitive performance was highly related to their learning performance in programming courses. Nevertheless, the relationship between operation span and the learning performance of programming courses for junior high school students has not been researched yet. In Taiwan, computer programming has already been included as a mandatory subject in the junior high school curriculum for developing students' computational thinking and problem-solving skills. As such, understanding the relationship between OSPAN and programming performance is crucial for effective teaching and learning in this subject. We designed an experiment for an IoT-related after-school club in a junior high school to evaluate the relationship between students’ operation span and learning performance.},

  abstract={This research investigates the impact of women's involvement in STEM education through the introductory programming and robotics course offered by the Computing Department at CEFET-MG. The course aims to foster logical reasoning, creativity, and computational thinking among students in the final years of public elementary schools. The study gathered data on the participation of women as students, monitors, and researchers from 2016 to 2024. These data were organized to create graphs supporting quantitative and qualitative analyses. The results show that including women researchers in the course, which began in 2022, has positively affected young women's participation. The lack of women in the department's faculty until 2022 highlights the importance of recent efforts to promote gender diversity within the course and the wider academic environment, promoting positive practices for advancing gender equality in fields where disparities persist.},

  abstract={This paper investigates how to provide meaningful scaffolding to bachelor humanities students, to enabled them to acquire Computational Thinking (CT) technical skills, and in particular basic programming competences. Two of the authors have been involved in the re-design, implementation and execution of a basic programming and CT course, offered to first-semester students as part of the Information science, IT and interaction design bachelor program, at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). The central problem we faced in restructuring our introductory course, was finding a game genre that could support creative coding for beginners, be motivational and recognizable by the students, and would work with our use-modify-create learning approach. Our findings suggest that point-and-click games are an effective way to provide scaffolding and ease non-technical students into P5 programming. The genre has good expressive power, and the students were motivated because they recognized and could relate to the games they worked on. Future work will address students’ problems with scaling up the point-and-click games.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a method to grade programming exam questions automatically. Our motivation is that there are no robust and scalable automatic methods for the analysis of computational thinking from source code programmed by elementary-level students. The approach to this problem supports the improvement of PC development in primary and secondary school students. The validation of the method is performed through the assessment of the answers of primary school students to programming exercises using a programming language called LIE++. The method assesses student answers using several techniques such as the analysis of programming structures, code clones and the execution of code based on input and output values defined during the specification of the exercises. The use of these techniques provides specific scores to obtain a grade of the student’s answer. The source code analysis and scoring of exercise answers is carried out using high-performance computing for improving system response time. This research contributes a scalable method for the automatic evaluation of exams, which we expect to support the development of PC.},

  abstract={As blended learning models gain popularity, analyzing the online learning behaviors of college students has emerged as a crucial approach to enhancing teaching effectiveness. The objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the learning behavior data from 44 students specializing in computer-related subjects on the online platform of the “Introduction to Computational Thinking” course, utilizing clustering algorithms. Subsequently, we utilized the Pearson correlation coefficient method to delve into the intricate relationship between diverse behavioral traits and academic performance. Our research has revealed that cluster analysis is adept at discerning behavioral disparities among students. Specifically, we identified four types of learning groups with different learning characteristics. Furthermore, a notable correlation was observed between homework scores and key evaluation metrics, including academic performance. Based on these findings, this study proposes targeted learning strategies and teaching suggestions, aiming to help educators better guide students in learning and improve the effectiveness of blended learning.},

  abstract={The rapid spread of the CoViD-19 pandemic in early 2020 and the adoption of social distancing and "stay-at-home" orders gave rise to the sudden need for schools to be able to provide effective remote teaching. In Italy and elsewhere, the introduction of distance learning technologies has significantly impacted the education of students and limited their social interaction and activities, among which are school trips and other scholastic experiences. To support the constrained educational possibilities of Italian schools, we developed "ActiveViewer", a technological platform that enables massive and interactive remote events, and performed a year-long large-scale experiment, providing a series of massive remote school trips to several Italian cities. We designed a new school trip format, named "CodyTrip" that merges coding and computational thinking with elements of traditional school outings, and provides an engaging experience for participants. In this paper, we present the format and five online trips performed during the school year 2020/2021. The results based on user feedback support the adoption of the tool not only as a stopgap measure for school outings throughout the pandemic but as an accessible and inclusive tool to widen the possibilities of cultural tourism.},

  abstract={This work-in-progress research paper presents an innovative learning methodology based on gamification and the concept of “building your own knowledge” to motivate and spark students' interest in quantum computing. Using the Scratch platform with younger high school students, basic quantum computing principles are taught through interactive mini-games, focusing on concepts like superposition and entanglement. For older students, a more formal methodology is proposed that uses the Bloch Sphere representation via the CreatiCode platform. This paper discusses an implementation of the proposal with high school groups, including statistical analysis and feedback collection to assess concept acquisition, strengths, weaknesses and student satisfaction. Data is gathered through questionnaires and interviews, enabling comparison with external test groups for comprehensive evaluation. This approach integrates computational thinking, gamification and visual knowledge construction, aligning with STEM education principles and fostering knowledge retention.},

  abstract={It is necessary to develop students to become lifelong learning of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to meet the challenges in the 21st century. Therefore, the STEM research center of Universitas Syiah Kuala in collaboration with other stakeholders in education, namely government, industry, public, and media has launched the Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Character (STEMC) learning approach. There are six aspects to be developed through the STEMC approach: critical thinking, creativity, communication, collaboration, computational thinking, and characters. In general, the nature of STEMC is not only a process of transferring knowledge from teachers to students but also an effort to build students' character. STEMC approach is designed to improve students' scientific abilities, motivation, and perseverance. It means that every phase of learning is designing to support students' intellectual and emotional growth. This paper aims to address what has been done at the STEM Research Center of Universitas Syiah Kuala and the plan for integrating STEMC in Indonesia. It provides an overview of some projects that have been conducted, such as the development of STEMC modules for senior high schools and collaboration with State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in teacher professional development programs. In addition, this paper also highlights the STEM center's plan to implement STEMC in Indonesia},

  abstract={The importance of educating the next generations in the understanding of the fundamentals of the upcoming scientific and technological innovations that will force a broad social and economical paradigm change can not be overstressed. One such breakthrough technologies is Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning algorithms. Nowadays, the public has little understanding of the workings and implications of AI techniques that are already entering their lives in many ways. We aim to achieve widespread public understanding of these issues in an experiential learning framework. Following a design based research approach, we propose to implement program coding scaffoldings to teach and experiment some basic mechanisms of AI systems. Such experiments would be shedding new light into AI potentials and limitations. In this paper we focus on innovative ways to introduce high school students to the fundamentals and operation of two of the most popular AI algorithms. We describe the elements of a workshop where we provide an academic use-create-modify scaffolding where students work on the Scratch partial coding of the algorithms so they can explore the behavior of the algorithm, gaining understanding of the underlying computational thinking of AI processes. The extent of the impact on the students of this experience is measured through questionnaires filled before and after participation in the workshop. Preliminary experiments offer encouraging results, showing that the workshop has differential impact on the way students understand AI.},

  abstract={As a novel framework in classroom teaching, digital games have gained traction. Anyone can play online games, that eventually ascribe potential for large-scale classroom instruction. Digital games have gained popularity in recent years as a way to encourage programming and computational thinking in pre-college (K-12) classrooms. Since the last decade, an ever-increasing number of learners have been drawn by the rapidly expanding areas of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Regardless of the fact that blending of AI/ML and online/digital gaming is a significant and critical subject for classroom pedagogy, there is indeed a paucity of comprehensive literature review in this domain. The aim of this paper is to take cognizance of recent studies and new findings on games that may be used to enhance AI/ML integrated pedagogy for effective curriculum transaction. Relevant articles and games were identified after a thorough exploration and were then included in this qualitative content analysis. This paper presents an overview of important published studies and games, as well as demonstrate how diverse games offer an exceptional and innovative prospect to educate a wealth of concepts and themes in AI and ML.},

Collectively, these activities are designed to introduce learners to the growing diversity of what CS looks like in the 21st century. This paper lays out the practical and theoretical motivations for the Computational Thinking for Girls (CT4G) project, specifically highlighting the use of Making through physical and social computing as ways to engage students in CS. A snapshot of one activity from the program is provided-Wearing the Web-in which students use open-hardware programmable badges to explore the underlying structure and technology that enables the Internet. Data from the first year of the CT4G program are presented to show the positive effects that this diverse introduction to CS is having on the students with respect to their attitudes toward CS.},

  abstract={Educational Robotics (ER) has revealed several benefits in the educational context, not only helping the teaching of disciplines, but also making possible the development of several abilities, such as teamwork, problem-solving, and creativity. Among various robotics kits, LEGO® Robotics has been shown one of the best results considering some evaluated criteria (modularity level, hardware, curriculum, price, etc.). Some studies analyze the teaching practices, some compare technologies, and others evaluate the kits in a pedagogical way. However, it is essential to investigate all these contexts together in order to improve the impact produced by the ER in education and to know the best teaching practices associated with the most powerful technologies. The objective of this Research Full Paper is to identify: a) environments and programming languages adopted in the LEGO® Robotics context, b) educational practices applied during classes based on LEGO® Robotics, and c) the educational levels in which robotics has been applied with positive results. To achieve these goals, we planned and carried out a systematic review of the literature. Our main findings are: a) the most widely used environment and programming language are LabVIEW along with the LEGO®'s block-based programming language, b) we identified LEGO® Robotics is used for teaching programming, interdisciplinary contents, participation in tournaments, robotics, and computational thinking, c) LEGO® Robotics is used with success by students of different levels, such as K12, undergraduate, and graduated. Finally, we discuss some problems and limitations related to ER and point out that there is no standardization of teaching practices or methodologies for evaluating results, indicating that more research is needed to find the best scenario regarding technologies, methods, and target audience.},

Evaluations of these in the context of free play and open-ended learning activities show that both systems afford opportunities for young children to engage in spatial programming, creating improvisational and sequential programs that mediate interactions between the environment, robots, and humans in responsive and creative ways. These systems demonstrate innovative opportunities for advancing mixed reality spatial programming activities as a form of HRI that fosters engaging seamless cyberlearning experiences, across formal and informal environments.},

  abstract={Currently, there is a "boom" in introductory programming courses to help students develop their computational thinking skills. Providing timely, personalized feedback that makes students reflect about what and why they did correctly or incorrectly is critical in such courses. However, the limited number of instructors and the great volume of submissions instructors need to assess, especially in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), prove this task a challenge. One solution is to hire graders or create peer discussions among students, however, feedback may be too general, incomplete or even incorrect. Automatic techniques focus on: a) Functional testing, in which feedback usually does not sufficiently guide novices, b) Software verification to find code bugs, which may confuse novices since these tools usually skip true errors or produce false errors, and c) Comparing using reference solutions, in which a large amount of reference solutions or pre-existing correct submissions are usually required. This paper presents a semantic-aware technique to provide personalized feedback that aims to mimic an instructor looking for code snippets in student submissions. These snippets are modeled as subgraph patterns with natural language feedback attached to them. Submissions are transformed into extended program dependence graphs combining control and data flows. We leverage subgraph matching techniques to compute the adequate personalized feedback. Also, constraints correlating patterns allow performing fine-grained assessments. We have evaluated our method on several introductory programming assignments and a large number of submissions. Our technique delivered personalized feedback in milliseconds using a small set of patterns, which makes it appealing in real-world settings.},

  abstract={Technology and computer learning have acquired a great projection in the field of education. Arduino arises from current technological innovations with the intention of promoting a new approach to learning through machines. The objective of this research is to analyze the evolution of the Arduino concept in the scientific literature. To achieve this aim, a bibliometric methodology based on scientific mapping and an analysis of co-words has been used. The scientific production of Arduino indexed in Web of Science has been analyzed. We have worked with an analysis unit of 346 documents. The results of this research show that the scientific production on Arduino in the field of education starts in 2010 until today. The communications in the congresses to present the results of the investigations developed are the most used means of diffusion. The National University of Distance Education and the Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu are particularly noteworthy. The authors with more scientific production in this field of study are Bogdan, M. and Castro, M. It is significant that the collection of studies on this subject is carried out, above all, by EDULEARN Proceedings and INTED Proceedings. It can be concluded that the field of study on Arduino in the educational field is relatively recent, so that today, the basis for scientific research is still being established. However, the most relevant aspects in this field of study are physic experiments, computational thinking and computer-based learning.},

  abstract={The need for more post-secondary students to major and graduate in STEM fields is widely recognized. Students' motivation and strategic self-regulation have been identified as playing crucial roles in their success in STEM classes. But, how students' strategy use, self-regulation, knowledge building, and engagement impact different learning outcomes is not well understood. Our goal in this study was to investigate how motivation, strategic self-regulation, and creative competency were associated with course achievement and long-term learning of computational thinking knowledge and skills in introductory computer science courses. Student grades and long-term retention were positively associated with self-regulated strategy use and knowledge building, and negatively associated with lack of regulation. Grades were associated with higher study effort and knowledge retention was associated with higher study time. For motivation, higher learning- and task-approach goal orientations, endogenous instrumentality, and positive affect and lower learning-, task-, and performance-avoid goal orientations, exogenous instrumentality and negative affect were associated with higher grades and knowledge retention and also with strategic self-regulation and engagement. Implicit intelligence beliefs were associated with strategic self-regulation, but not grades or knowledge retention. Creative competency was associated with knowledge retention, but not grades, and with higher strategic self-regulation. Implications for STEM education are discussed.},

Currently, innovation and motivation of students during the learning process are promoted by educational robotics tools. Robots are increasingly integrated into our society. To such an extent that robots are becoming more and more common in our everyday environment. This paper presents a workshop which is focused on two main objectives. The first one is to celebrate Scratch Day promoting Scratch locally. On the other hand, this event is aimed to present a robotic educational tool for people as the first step to get into robotics world. This workshop is aimed on those adults who want to discover what possibilities Scratch brings in the introduction to robotics. Throughout this workshop an initiation to Scratch is developed in the context of educational robotics. As the most significant results throughout the workshop, it is clearly demonstrated that Scratch is an ideal tool for children and adults with no previous programming or robotic experience to begin learning both through hands-on experiences. Throughout this work the importance of combining theory and practice is shown in order to include fun tasks intertwined with the challenges of applying theory to problem solving.},

  abstract={There is a strong movement asserting the importance of quality education all over the world and for students of all ages. Many educators believe that in order to achieve this 21st century skills must be taught and that digital literacy should be coupled with rigorous Computer Science principles and computational thinking. Accordingly this work will describe a didactic experience in an introductory programming course by describing the context, pedagogical approach, content of the course based on a procedure-first approach, technologies used, research questions addressed, experimental design adopted, data collection and analysis and the main conclusion supported by qualitative and quantitative data. The research questions focus on understanding which is the best medium to design algorithms by comparing flow chart and the Scratch programming language and by evaluating whether using textual language is worth the effort of the syntactic burden imposed by these languages. An analysis of quantitative and qualitative data revealed that both a visual programming and a flow-chart approach are suitable for algorithm design with no statistical difference in terms of number of errors and time taken to write the corresponding code in a textual language. However, the high number of errors suggest that using visual programming allows the student to focus on the problem solving activities.},

  abstract={Robotics and computational thinking are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. Today, educational robotics tools emerge with the aim of promoting innovation and motivation of students during the learning process. Robots are becoming more common in our daily lives; therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our society. This demonstrator focuses on driving the same content through three low-cost robotic educational tools. The first is Scratch, where you can schedule interactive stories, games and animations. The second tool is Crumble, an easy-to-use programmable controller. Its programming interface uses a block programming language that facilitates its use. Finally, Arduino is an open source, hardware- and software-based platform that is easy to use and has great potential for developing robotic applications. This demonstrator aims to present the above platforms as educational robotics tools as the first step into the world of robotics. Throughout this demonstrator an introduction to educational robotics is developed.},

  abstract={There is a strong worldwide movement which is pushing for the teaching of serious computer science principles besides reading, writing and basic numeracy starting from first grade and reaching all students across all grades. This is being done through both formal initiatives carried out by international organizations and at the national level by putting forward curricula, some of which are mandatory. In order to accomplish this goal, and based on the consensus that computer science is not programming and that programming languages are a tool, visual languages have become the preferred method for teaching introductory courses in computer science. The absence of rigid syntactic rules makes them the ideal tool for focusing on problem solving and computational thinking activities. Recent reports have pointed out the need for supporting the international community of teachers by providing assessment methods, an internationally validated question repository as well as tools and assessment platforms. In this context our work presents an assessment platform for formative, summative and informal assessment of computer science competencies by using a visual language, namely App Inventor, which allows for the rapid development of a mobile app and has a strong appeal to the younger generation of students. The capability to log user activity allows the teacher to monitor the progression in the student's learning path as well as her/his solution-building approach.},

  abstract={The planning and scheduling of container terminal logistics systems (CTLS) are the multi-objective and multiple strong constraints combinatorial optimization challenges under the uncertain environments, and those are provided with high goal orientation, dynamics, context-sensitivity, coupling, timeliness, and complexity. The increasingly sophisticated decision-making for CTLS is one of the most pressing problems for the programming and optimization method available. This paper discusses CTLS in terms of logistics generalized computation complexity based on computational thinking, great principles of computing, and computational lens, which three are abbreviated with 3CTGPL, and makes a definition of container terminal oriented logistics generalized computational complexity (CTO-LGCC) and container terminal logistics generalized computation comprehensive performance perspective (CTL-GCCPP) from the dimensions of time, space, communication, processor, and memory access. Both can analyze, generalize, migrate, translate, localize, modificate, and evaluate the above-complicated problems and lay solid foundations and establish a feedback improvement framework for the computational model and scheduling algorithms of the CTLS, which is an essential complement to the modeling and optimization methodology and solutions to CTLS with computational logistics. Finally, aimed at the logistics service cases for a large-scale container terminal, the simulation is designed and implemented for different scheduling algorithms, and the qualitative and quantitative comprehensive analysis is executed for the concomitant CTO-LGCC that demonstrates and verifies the feasibility and credibility of the CTO-LGCC and CTL-GCCPP from the viewpoint of the practice of container terminal decision-making support on the tactical level.},

  abstract={We are entering a new AI era, and the development of AI technology and popularization of AI education has become the national strategy of China. The primary and secondary school students are the builder of future society, and have strong curiosity and passion to learn new things; therefore, we should make a good preparation of AI education for them and cultivate their basic AI literacy and computational thinking to adapt to the future. In this paper, from the viewpoint of thinking mode and literacy and skill training, a curriculum including basic, project, and practical types is designed. Integrating with the iSTREAM educational system proposed by Chinese Academy of Sciences, exploratory works were shown with some case studies. The applications show that AI education is helpful to enrich the study of primary and secondary school students and to prompt comprehensive quality.},
