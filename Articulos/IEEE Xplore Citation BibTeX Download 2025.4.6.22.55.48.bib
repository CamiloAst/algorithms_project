  abstract={As computational thinking (CT) emerges as a required skill in the modern educational and professional landscape, the use of games for learning programming has gained prominence. However, consideration for the user's needs and experiences is as important as the educational content itself, in order to ensure that the learner has an engaging experience. For this reason, this paper explores the integration of Empathic Design principles into the user experience (UX) evaluation of several popular programming genre games aimed at cultivating CT. The findings indicate a partial positive alignment with these principles, particularly in user-centric design, learning journey, and visual aspects. Learner-players feedback emphasized engaging experiences and visual appeal, while improvement suggestions centered on enhancing interface depth, providing clearer instructions, and addressing challenges for beginners and scalability issues.},

  abstract={The goal of this research full paper is to provide insight into most recent findings of interviews with faculty members teaching digital skills in an integrated and innovative way embedded into courses on subject didactics of a teacher education program. Pre-studies analyzing students' perspectives regarding the inclusion of digital competences in the teacher education program of a large Central-European university revealed that less than half of the students who were at an advanced stage in their studies felt sufficiently prepared to impart digital competences in their daily teaching. Given the importance of being digitally competent in the modern, digital era, the question arises, how digital competences can be sustainably included in the curriculum of a teacher education program. This paper analyzes interviews with five faculty members successfully teaching digital skills in concert with subject didactics of Geography in order to identify best practices for the integration of digital competences. The first author asked our Interview Partners to provide insight into the content they mediated, the integration of digital competences and tools in their courses, how their teaching could be further improved, and what challenges they encounter. Eventually, we looked for best practices and collected instructors' thoughts on improvements on a curricular level and examples of transferring the good practices to other subjects, such that future students could benefit from a better integration of digital competences. For this paper, we analyzed the data with a mixture of narrative analysis and thematic analysis. Improving the mediating of digital skills and competences in a wider range of subjects at the university level should eventually help students, and ultimately their students, to implement digital know-how such as modern teaching tools into their courses, making teaching more effective and computational thinking as well as related fields of computing more accessible to academic as well as secondary and younger students. The research so far has shown promising results considering examples of tools that can be used on a broad spectrum of subjects and lead to a factor of learned new digital competences if used properly. On the other hand, lecturers also warned about relying too much on technology in specific tasks such as orientation on a map or analyzing statistical data. We conclude that combining existing approaches with new, more modern didactics can be the key to transferring the competencies required for our students' future.},

  abstract={This document presents a systematic review of Visual Programming Tools for the Arduino Board. The Arduino board is an embedded platform that focus on enabling an easy way to teach embedded systems, but, due to its success, it ended up being used in different teaching levels, ranging from primary to university. The board was also applied in the teaching of robotics and other contexts since it is relatively cheap, easy to program and its community has produced a considerable amount of free educational material. Even though Arduino is a success it is still maturing in terms of educational purposes, aside the electronic knowledge that needs to be explored, the board is programmed, by default, with c++, which is considered not friendly to Computer Thinking beginners. Trying to solve this problem, many solutions apply Visual Programming, which is proven to make it easy for unexperienced and even children to learn the basis of Computational Thinking, in the educational context with Arduino. Even though there are many solutions applying visual programming for Arduino, there are no systematic review or survey on this subject, meaning that it is hard to identify where are the gaps and which are the problems that are already solved. Therefore, on this paper, it was performed a systematic review on the subject, the method found 372 papers, which 31 were selected for full review. The reviewed solutions where discussed and categorized, we expect that the presented results could be used as guideline for new research in the area and by educators and companies that are looking for visual programming tools for the Arduino board.},

  abstract={This Research-to-Practice Full Paper aims to introduce a methodological framework to foster Computational Thinking (CT) skills by teaching programming with Educational Robotics (ER) in High School. Problem-solving is an essential skill for human development, so it is necessary to introduce actions to improve this skill in High School. It is possible to stimulate problem- solving through computer programming teaching with ER. However, as far as we know, there are no methodologies for teaching programming with ER focusing on CT development in High School that went through scientific validation of the proposal. This study is an Educational Design Research that aims to introduce a methodological framework for teaching programming in High School with ER (named CTProgER) and validate two instances of the framework. It was considered consolidated teaching methodologies with ER, combined with the Anthropological Theory of Didactics and evidence from our ER studies. As a result, we present the CTProgER Framework guideline, two instances of the CTProgER Framework, and these instances’ validation through the Delphi method.},

  abstract={Undergraduate software engineering courses typically require students to work on team-based projects that reinforce disciplinary content and soft skills. At the same time, these students, particularly those at liberal arts institutions, are required to take courses that focus on civic issues, including on racial and ethnic inequality. Often, students perceive these courses to be outside their disciplinary areas, and may not comprehend how these topics are applicable to computer science and software engineering. This paper reports on the experience of Pulimood and Leigey as they and their students grappled with issues of racial injustice in the criminal justice system, and drew upon their own disciplinary backgrounds to apply computational thinking and software engineering principles to help the community better understand these issues and advocate for reform. The paper also describes the experience of teaching courses from different disciplines in a collaborative model, working closely with a local community partner to support its work on an identified social issue, and the learning outcomes, as well as the benefits and challenges of this approach. Recommendations and future directions are also discussed.},

  abstract={Today, teaching faces several challenges, including students’ difficulty in understanding abstract concepts and lack of motivation. To address these problems, the use of virtual reality (VR) has been explored as an innovative and potentially effective educational tool. However, so far, the effectiveness of VR applications and the perception of their use lack a clear and effective approach to be used to support education. The importance of addressing this problem lies in the need to improve the quality of teaching using emerging technologies. It is for this reason that it is important to find new strategies to improve the effectiveness of teaching using VR. In this context, this research presents the results of the FreeDev application, previously validated with 20 teachers and with 80 engineering students from a private university. FreeDev is a VR application designed to support the teaching of basic programming, it is aimed as an educational tool to provide an immersive experience to students on how to get started in programming and computational thinking. FreeDev has been well accepted, and both teachers and engineering students see it as a tool that can be used to support education. It is hoped that this research will contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field of education.},

  abstract={Computational thinking ability is important in computer science education. It emphasizes abstraction and automation. For automation, programming has become a key ability in digital society recently. As a result, the increase in the importance of coding education in many countries has brought various educational methods to improve teenagers' programming abilities. Among programming abilities, reading ability is important especially to programming novices. This paper focuses on the effects of gender and abstract thinking abilities of adolescents on understanding computer programs. Also, we examine if there is any difference in teaching between adolescents and college students. In order to achieve our research goals, we surveyed on the abstract thinking level, and then measured program understanding ability for 300 academic high school students who had learned C language. From this research, we found that the abstract thinking affects more complex program understanding positively. Also, we found that the language experience before learning brought the difference in program understanding. However, we could not find statistical differences in program understanding between two genders. From this research, we can provide a new point of view to improve adolescents' programming ability with abstract thinking and gender factors.},

Yet, our ability to respond to the well-documented need for a large, diverse, computationally literate workforce remains a challenge. We summarize our 35 years of lessons learned for preparing the workforce that can inform efforts to address this challenge. We have pursued a multiprong approach to reach instructors, researchers, professionals, and students on a national scale. Our efforts in scaling up and sustaining activities range from teaching computational thinking through imparting HPC skills. We have been able to scale up these activities through community efforts to share, cooperate, and collaborate.

  abstract={Cloud adoption in industrial sectors, such as process, manufacturing, health care, and finance, is steadily rising, but as it grows, the risk of targeted cyberattacks has increased. Hence, effectively defending against such attacks necessitates skilled cybersecurity professionals. Traditional human-based cyber-physical education is resource intensive and faces challenges in keeping pace with rapidly evolving technologies. This research focuses on the main advantages of incorporating large language models into cyber-physical education. The ChatGPT platform serves as an online tool to educate students on fundamentals, cyberattacks, and defense concepts, fostering the development of a new generation cybersecurity experts. The proposed learning approach adheres to the ChatGPT-assisted learn–apply–create model. Responding to prompts provided by the learners, the learning phase engages in conceptual learning, the applying phase involves mathematical modeling of various cyberattacks, and the creating phase develops MATLAB program to incorporate attacks into sensor measurements for the experiment and entails developing the necessary attack detection approaches. The effectiveness of the detection method developed by ChatGPT is assessed in both the simulation and real-time scenarios using a J-type thermocouple. The impact of the proposed learning platform over traditional learning methods is evaluated through an extensive comparative feedback analysis on the learner's foundational concepts, computational thinking, programming efficacy, and motivation. The study proved that integrating ChatGPT into engineering education enables students to swiftly learn cyber-physical fundamentals, comprehend and model cyberattacks, create new attack signatures, and contribute to developing detection algorithms. Such integration provides the learners with essential industrial skills crucial in modern industries.},

  abstract={This full research paper focuses on the design of a Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which supports the sharing of teaching practices (TPs) amongst computer science instructors. Many years of valuable TPs can be lost due to academic retirement when no competent knowledge management system is available for recording these TPs. Consequently, novice teachers are currently facing critical challenges when delivering subject knowledge that relates to algorithms, programming and the development of computational thinking skills without the benefit of others' experience. After a study of the relevant literature, it could be seen that far too little attention has been paid to the capturing and sharing of TPs which are not easily expressed or communicated in visual or verbal terms. Thus, we design and then demonstrate a Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which supports the capturing of TPs. A quantitative and a qualitative evaluation of users' experiences of employing the system shows that instructors are satisfied with it and are mostly positive about its features. The findings of this study hold considerable promise in relation to developing engaging and effective knowledge sharing systems for use by academic instructors.},

  year={2024},
  volume={67},
  number={2},
  pages={266-281},
  abstract={Contribution: This research illuminates information entropy’s efficacy as a pivotal educational tool in programming, enabling the precise quantification of algorithmic complexity and student abstraction levels for solving P problems. This approach can provide students quantitative, comparative insights into the differences between optimal and student implemented solution, and allowing educators to offer targeted feedback, thereby optimizing the learning and abstraction processes in algorithm design through deliberate practice. Background: Abstraction is considered one of the most impor11 tant skills in problem solving. Many studies in programming have shown that higher abstraction capability can significantly simplify problems, reduce program complexity and improve efficiency. However, it is difficult to develop criteria to measure the level of abstraction, and there is still a lack of relevant systematic research. Research Questions: 1) How can students’ abstraction ability in programming be effectively measured? 2) How to develop programming education and training methods based on the measurement of abstraction ability? Methodology: Forty-six grade 10 students participated in the experiment, divided into two groups for programming train23 ing using information-entropy-based assessment and traditional learning methods. Their level of computational thinking, algo25 rithmic efficiency improvements, and test scores were used to measure performance and to analyze the effectiveness of the training methods. Findings: Through empirical research, this article finds that information-entropy-based assessment can reflect the differences in problem solving among students possessing varying capa31 bilities. Information entropy can be crucial for evaluating and improving students’ abstraction performance and algorithm efficiency.},

  abstract={This paper presents the Historical Black Lives Matter (HBLM) case study, an exploratory application of interactive data visualization to a collection of manumissions documents in the Legacy of Slavery (LoS) project at the Maryland State Archives, with the goal of enhancing discovery and recovering hidden knowledge. The case study extends prior interdisciplinary research on applying computational treatments to LoS collections and contributes to research in Computational Archival Science (CAS), computational thinking, and data visualization to enhance access to archival collections. Three design objectives are addressed: representation of people, user experience, and facilitation of knowledge discovery. The paper is organized to demonstrate a customizable workflow for the process of formulating design based on data visualization principles, implementing designs with open-source tools, and incorporating user evaluation in service to successfully fulfilling the design objectives and related functionality in the final implemented design. Examples of hidden knowledge recovered using the visualizations are presented, providing new insights into Maryland’s antebellum Black population. The data visualization design methods and practices permitted investigation at a more granular level, and enabled communication of a richer narrative. Use of open-source software makes these methods accessible to archivists, information professionals, and researchers, and supports creation of artifacts for research, teaching and learning. Future extensions could incorporate advanced computational techniques to enable map features, network and textual analysis, and dynamic query-based composition of visualizations.},

  abstract={In the last decade, educational reforms introduced technologies and digital tools to a higher degree, serving as powerful catalysts in educational innovation for creating, managing, and delivering content in STEM education with a focus on computational and engineering subjects. However, in the small reality of the classroom, some discrepancies arise between policy objectives and everyday practice. The research community emphasises the importance of providing technology infusions based on educators' pedagogical beliefs as well as needs rooted in the authentic scholarly environment. Considering this perspective when orchestrating in-classroom technology can support educators in their daily experiences and enhance their digital competencies. To contribute to this aim, we propose a case study carried out via interviews with fellow primary and secondary teachers, tackling challenges in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), including Computer Science (CS) and Computational thinking (CT) education delivery. Along with the teachers' perspectives, our study aims to obtain a detailed account of the classroom's internal dynamics as perceived by the teachers. The most prominent findings concern the disparity among educators' proficiency in technology endorsement, impacting the consistency in content delivery, the complexity of the assessment of students' learning process if it is digital-based, and the inclusivity and trustworthiness of online content. Finally, we suggest guidance for a further mindful in-school uptake of technology to support teachers in orchestrating content delivery with educational technologies and enhance their confidence in this aspect.},

  abstract={Programming has been part of Swedish elementary school curriculum for six years and the aim of this full paper is to find out how teachers can design programming activities so that students engage and learn. A mix-methods research project with a social semiotic, multimodal theoretical framework – Designs for learning – is used to investigate teaching and learning in a class during three years. The results in this small-scale study indicate that collaboration is a successful didactic design for programming lessons in school. Computational thinking is prevalent and both digital skills (such as coding) and digital competencies (such as understanding the impact of technology in society) are practiced and met in programming lessons merging Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics.},

  abstract={Computational thinking, problem-solving and the ability to apply knowledge; these and a plethora of other skills are essential for success in both personal and professional life. In order to be able to develop those skills in their students, the teachers themselves need to possess them. This paper focuses on female future lower primary school teachers who, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, took an online course on algorithmization and programming, having little or no prior knowledge and skills. The completion rate depended not only on the students' motivation and willingness to learn, but mainly on the content and structure of the course, which was completely modified and made into an online course. The results were more than surprising. The students were able to complete the activities included in the course. Moreover, those activities inspired them to create their own activities, which they may be able to use in their future classes.},

  abstract={Cultivating students' innovative ability has been playing an important role in the process of program design courses in Colleges and Universities. This paper focuses on presenting practical experience of the programming and designing patterns in teaching Python programming. Combining MBO (Management By Objective) with teaching, an optimized teaching model of Python Programming based on MBO. The model consists of four parts: Knowledge objectives, Technology ability objectives, Thinking Developed objectives, extended ability objectives. Following the four main goals, this paper introduces relevant teaching practices based on each objective. Applying the model , the quality of planned teaching and learning can be improved. Because setting clear goals could make it easy to formulate plans, tasks, teaching contents, track learning effects and test learning consequences. According to the model, the course teaching practice will highlight the importance of teaching Program concretely and effectively. Most significantly, teachers could train students to gradually develop computational thinking and apply it in subsequent courses.},

  abstract={Building on the success of the first North-South cross-continental collaborative educational robotics mission held in November 2015 [1], this paper presents a practical model for scaling the event up into a program for developing countries, particularly those of Africa, where the first edition took place. Past participants in Remote Rescue Thymio II (R2T2) missions, students and educators alike, have shared qualitative observations about its positive educational impact, notably in the areas of Collaboration, Communication, Critical thinking, Creative problem solving, Computational thinking, and Cross-cultural exchange. The proposed framework for delivering R2T2 missions has been adapted to Africa, being specifically designed to tackle the critical challenges of internet connectivity, teacher training and program costs. In so doing, it strives to pave the way for collaboration with partners in African educational ecosystems and North-South funding bodies that share the vision of making collaborative STEM education more accessible and attractive to teachers and schoolchildren around the world.},

  abstract={Because of its ability to prepare students for the 21st century world of work, educational robotics (RE) has assumed a prominent role in education. Following the methodology provided by Kitchenham, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to provide a comprehensive overview of studies, research, and practices related to robotics education in higher education. The study focuses on identifying the most commonly used RE hardware-based platforms in academic research publications, the type of knowledge intended to be imparted, and the skills or competencies reinforced by the platforms. Within the findings we can underline that there is no exclusive platform, but rather commercial ones are used, made by the researchers themselves, and even adapted from robots that were not designed for instructional purposes. Moreover, the subjects intended to be taught were all related to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and oriented to electrical engineering, electronics, robotics, and computer science professions. On the other hand, the skills that improved the most were computational thinking, cooperation and sophisticated problem solving, which are essential for 21st century job descriptions.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present a proposal for a series of STEAM activities developing students’ computational thinking, improving their health literacy, and consequently taking care of their own well-being. The implementation of these activities in the classroom requires not only the knowledge and skills of informatics and biology, but also the collaboration of teachers of both subjects. These activities are implemented in phases, starting in biology lesson and continuing in informatics lesson. The first activity tests the level of sensitivity of people to colour differences. The second activity trains human adaptation to psychological stress. The third activity is focused on creation of compensatory aid that compensates for colour perception disorder. The design and programming of students’ STEAM applications is a meaningful way to use informatics in problem solving. Using and experimenting with these applications helps students to better understand the biological content. STEAM approach strengthens students’ orientation towards interdisciplinary studies (e.g. bioinformatics) at the higher education level and helps them to be more employable in the labour market.},

  abstract={In the last decades, our society has become massively technology-dependent. Various solutions, such as Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR), can be involved in learning processes to enhance the students’ experience, while elements of gamification can be implemented to engage and keep the users motivated. In this paper, we summarize current research and introduce our relevant development projects about students’ algorithmic, programming, and visual skills. One of the tangible results of our research is an in-house serious game development project. SpreGosts was designed and implemented to develop the essential computational thinking skills of students in a spreadsheet-like virtual environment. Parallel, the viSkillz research team has already published open-source packages and pilot applications, providing essential assets to construct classic spatial ability tests.},
