  abstract={Information technologies are the base of the world infrastructure. In this social context, education, like any productive or service sector, is affected by technology. Faced with this reality, educational systems must prepare our young people to live in the digital world, for which they must be proficient in a new language without which they will become digital illiterates. Therefore, in school we should not only train in linguistic and numerical literacy, but also in digital literacy. So far, the effort has been oriented mainly to convert our young people into users of computer tools. This has gone from being necessary to being insufficient, because the use of software applications means to manage a digital language that is obsolete in a time that is not proportional, in effort, to the time that has been invested in acquiring these skills. Therefore, the challenge is to prepare our young people to face the world in which they live, giving them the necessary cognitive tools to succeed in the digital world. That is, instead of teaching students only the syntax of a changing language, they should be instructed in the rules that allow them to know how the digital language is constructed. Thus, computational thinking emerges as a paradigm of work, and the programming is stablished as the tool to solve problems.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. My vision for the 21st Century: computational thinking will be a fundamental skill used by everyone in the world. To reading, writing, and arithmetic, let's add computational thinking to every child's analytical ability. Computational thinking has already influenced other disciplines, from the sciences to the arts. The new NSF cyber-enabled discovery and innovation initiative in a nutshell is computational thinking for science and engineering. Realizing this vision gives the field of computing both exciting research opportunities and novel educational challenges. The field of computing is driven by technology innovation, societal demands, and scientific questions. We are often too easily swept up with the rapid progress in technology and the surprising uses by society of our technology, that we forget about the science that underlies our field. In thinking about computing, I have started a list of "Deep Questions in Computing," with the hope of encouraging the community to think about the scientific drivers of our field.},

  abstract={In order to meet broadening participation goals for computer science, it is important to consider how pedagogy and design may impact different learners in different ways. Individual characteristics related to prior experience, social context, ethnic/racial identity, and gender identity may each play a part in how the design of a learning experience influences student engagement, attitudes, interests, skills, and knowledge. To examine these relationships, this talk will present findings and implications of research conducted in conjunction with the design and development of The Science Behind Pixar, a large traveling exhibition created collaboratively by the Museum of Science, Boston and Pixar Animation Studios. This exhibition, which features experiences that demonstrate how Pixar filmmakers use computational thinking and creativity to approach complex artistic and technical challenges, used several distinct engagement strategies and pedagogical approaches to guide exhibit design. This presentation will examine how these design approaches related to learning, engagement, and broadening participation goals.},

  abstract={End-user programmers have experiences of computation that are different from those of professional software engineers or people trained in computer science. We now understand that these different experiences arise from different motivations, different approaches to the task of programming, and different expectations about the outcomes. This talk reports results from a 10 year programme of research, engaging with collaborators who have been sought out precisely because their motivations, work methods and intentions are as different as possible from typical engineering programmers. These investigations have involved the development of a wide range of novel programmable systems and notations designed for use by choreographers, composers, musicians, and visual artists. The findings extend previous analyses of computational experience such as the attention investment model of abstraction use, and the cognitive dimensions of notations, drawing attention to ways of programming that are not only utilitarian, but playful and engaging. Research of this kind also helps us to understand that there are not necessarily different kinds of people in the world - those who are creative or not - but rather different ways of engaging with technology, available to all designers painting from the palette of human-centric computing systems.},

  abstract={There have been many periods in the unfolding of human history when we have asserted that it was possible to catalog all that was known or that could be known. Ignoring the pragmatic reality of trying to catalog an ever-expanding corpus, one must understand that such a task is further complicated by cultural and situational bias: what is important to know at one place and time is not necessary important in another. So it is with our present day; this raises the question, what must a functioning member of society know about computing? The Web extra at http://youtu.be/PjR6GqobTBo is an audio podcast of author Grady Booch reading his On Computing column, in which he discusses how much a functioning member of society today should know about computing.},

  abstract={Blocks programming environments (e.g., Scratch, Blockly, App Inventor, Snap!, Pencil Code, Alice/Looking Glass, AgentSheets/AgentCubes) represent program syntax trees as compositions of visual blocks. Through activities like Code.org's Hour of Code, these languages have become extremely popular ways to introduce programming and computational thinking to tens of millions of people of all ages and backgrounds, from grade-schoolers to President Obama. Proponents of blocks languages claim that blocks languages lower barriers to programming and enhance learning, while detractors complain that they are not particularly visual and are just toy languages from which it is difficult to transition to “real” text-based programming.},
